Very cool looking, but I wouldn't want to see the series remade like this. An episode like *[Reincarnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation_\(Futurama\))* would be neat though.

In case you guys missed it, professional player feedback was that the Bo3 format [wasn't actually the primary reason the region improved](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/73ac9a/na_lcs_format_update_for_2018/dnouuns/). I can see that and I honestly think some of you guys, especially the OP, are putting way too much emphasis on a game format being the sole or most important reason that it seems NA is more competitive. The teams are much closer to their own improvement process than outside fans are, so everything the OP has said are reasons for Bo3 being better are immediately suspect as actually credible. And let's not overlook the facts - despite this being more competitive, it hasn't translated into Worlds success.I'm ok with the format going back to Bo1 from the perspective that I definitely was one of probably a lot of fans who watch more than a casual number of games but who just didn't have the time to invest watching Bo3s end to end, even not live. I watch a ton of competitive League but seeing the same 2 teams for 3 hours is a pretty big weekly time investment when you factor in that most fans are interested in watching multiple teams.Really my concern and criticism for Riot is that they're not enforcing the same format across regions. I get that because there's different entities running competitive play that this isn't always easy or maybe even possible to do, but to not have all your leagues play the same format just means competitively, players are playing the game differently because prep for the format differs. It's like saying the NBA's West teams should play a series Bo3 with their schedules while the East teams would play Bo1 with different teams on different nights for the most part as per normal. It's inconsistent in terms of how the game is supposed to be competitively played on a week-by-week basis, especially in the sense of determining standings and playoff seeding, and should be the same across the board if at all possible.
>It's more interesting to watch a 2 or 3 game seriesthe majority would disagree.riot even said it themselves. they looked at their metrics and they found out that viewers only watch 1 or 2 games of the bo3, tune in when they can, and most people don't even finish watching the whole series.https://youtu.be/oyqB4LK_MAY?t=2143

Good. But it is not enough. Many cabinet members are abusing their authority while millions of American citizens on Puerto Rico suffer.This entire administration is a plutocratic kakistocracy - the wealthy have taken control of every department of government, who are utterly unqualified and do not wish to serve the interests of their citizens, instead they serve their own interests and are at the behest of extreme corporate greed.[Forbes - The $4.3 Billion Cabinet: See What Each Top Trump Advisor Is Worth](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2017/07/05/the-4-3-billion-cabinet-see-what-each-top-trump-advisor-is-worth/#5f7e99285dfc)>America's first billionaire president has remained devoted to the goal of placing his wealthy friends in his Cabinet, a top campaign promise.

But kleptocracy is not the same as kakistocracy: They do both capture the element of least qualified or the worst, but with different meanings. Taking a reductionist stance for the sake of making the point, Putin’s regime is more of a kleptocracy, a regime ruled by thieves and thugs but that does not mean Putin is politically incompetent or stupid. Sisi’s Egypt shows elements of kakistocracy where stupidity is clearly characteristic of the personalities and decision-making process.

I suggest installing Fixt mod (Fixes only option if it's your first run)http://www.nma-fallout.com/threads/fallout-fixt-0-81alpha-july-5th-2015.194562/This community patch includes fixing bugs, restoring features, modifying balance, adding new features, and many fixes to text/dialog.

[Here's the ultimate unofficial patch for F1.](http://www.nma-fallout.com/resources/fallout-fixt-full-all-fixes-and-mods.8/)

Hey, I have not played this before, but is the time limit still in it?

This almost happened to me when I was like 12 years old, they sell these things in Sweden although they are illegal to sell because you can choke on them. So anyways I bought one and you usually blow outwards to make that funny sound, but it also makes a different sound when you blow inwards too (although it's not intended to be used this way) So when I did that I lost grip of it and it flew down my throat really fast and I choked on it and instantly was able to cough it up thankfully. But damn that shit made me panic badly. It could be compared to something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaS6diS7pF8)

Welcome to the 1980s. Looks like you picked the wrong week to quit smoking.TIL that Airplane! is also a near scene-for-scene remake of the 1957 serious disaster movie [Zero Hour]( http://www.slashfilm.com/lol-see-how-airplane-liberally-borrowed-from-1957-thriller-zero-hour/) .Zero Hour features a passenger plane with the crew afflicted by food poisoning, and an unwilling ex-pilot named Ted Striker who has to land the plane.  Many scenes in Airplane! copy the dialogue, lighting or framing of the same scene in Zero Hour. The Zucker Brothers even bought the rights to the movie so they wouldn't be sued.And here's the [side by side comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BjU-e01zQ4),courtesy Neatorama.

It's been lost in the chaff, but the US Navy's hospital ship USNS COMFORT deployed today for Puerto Rico from Norfolk, VA.She is the second largest level one trauma center in the eastern US, 13 stories tall and the length of 3 football fields and she will be in San Juan in a few days to be the regional trauma and specialty referral center for Puerto Rico and the Caribbean at large.She can make her own power, water, and oxygen; has a wide array of satellite and radio communications systems, can embark both military and civilian health care providers, and is a critical command and control node for disaster relief operations for the Department of Defense.Here is an idea for what she brings to the table:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JNNYaINshQ

everyone tried to warn Trump and his fellow Republicans about how shady Price was... instead, [they changed Senate rules to force him through anyways.](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/politics/republicans-vote-to-suspend-committee-rules-advance-mnuchin-price-nominations/index.html)> Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, pointed to the "extraordinary circumstances" surrounding the gathering and allowed the Republicans in the room vote to suspend the rules of the committee.> With the committee rules suspended, the 14 Republicans in the room voted to move the Mnuchin and Price nominations to the full Senate, even without the presence of a single member of the opposite party.
And in today's version of "Of course there's a tweet for that":https://twitter.com/RepTomPrice/status/20977565808> It’s an honor to be named a "Taxpayer Hero" by the Council of Citizens Against Government Waste for fighting on behalf of taxpayers.
$1M worth of taxpayer paid fancy travel is hardly the worst thing about Tom Price.He [made brazen insider stock trades](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/hhs-pick-tom-price-made-brazen-stock-trades-committee-scrutiny/) on healthcare companiesHis HHS department is doing everything they can to sabotage Obamacare, including literally [shutting down the website](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/353010-dem-reps-to-price-shorten-obamacare-site-shutdowns-during-enrollment-period) for "maintenance"He's a piece of shit, but only one piece of many in the Trump administration.

He is the one who was actively trying to kill the NIH for some reason, even though a lot of his inside trading relied on research advances coming out of there: https://www.statnews.com/2017/03/29/tom-price-nih-budget/What a piece of shit.  Attacking the NIH should be the new 3rd rail

From the end of the BBC article>Interior department spokeswoman Heather Swift said in a statement that, as with previous interior secretaries, Mr Zinke "travelled on charter flights when there were no commercial options available".>"All travel is pre-approved by the ethics office before booking and the charter flights went through an additional level of due diligence," she said.Ethics Office Director Walter Shaub Resigned July 6, 2017, Saying Rules Need To Be Tougherhttp://www.npr.org/2017/07/06/535781749/ethics-office-director-walter-shaub-resigns-saying-rules-need-to-be-tougher
