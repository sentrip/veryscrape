Has this been photocopied...?
That must be the most well placed 'you tried' I've ever seen.
What we don't know is that this guy did all of this on purpose only to jump on a second account to bust himself
This seems like it was originally a joke to me.
Wait, did he *also* make the post calling himself out for replying to himself?
Let's hope he was just high as balls lol

Also you're isn't even correct. What a jackass 
Sometimes idk if I should upvote or downvote things on this sub.

I want these but with Michael Cera
I've seen these, I think they're great
I can only imagine the wrong person wearing these
She can pull it off so it looks sexy. This type of thing is very body type specific. I can see why some people would say it's trashy but I would be more likely to date a girl with a sense of humor like this.

Damn, what a huge ass. It only took one Atlas to hold up the world!

Only Atlas could hold that up

This is one of those few situations where it is debatable to see this and not cringe, at least for me, I would have something to comment on, so that's a potentially embarrassment free comment plus. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
They should have put Socrates on there 
Looks ghetto
Kinda silly and clever but honestly really dumb I would never actually wear those

>these leggings...  that _ass_
Had to upvote
Leggings: Still not pants.
Wtf, this is incredibly sexist.
ATBGA
People who wear leggings as pants should be locked away from society. It's just bad taste and looks ugly 
This sub should be renamed to "things I do not like and everyone should hate on."
I am honestly a fan or nice, proportional butts. I do not like this. It's just too big and flabby. I'd rather have a smaller, well-toned butt.Also, there is a difference between sexy and stupid - this is stupid.
My first attempt at drawing anything like this. Was inspired by the maps on www.elventower.com. Highly recommend checking it out if you like stuff like this. Plan to use it in the 5e campaign I am currently running. If it is not clear, you access the bottom floor via the elevator, and the Xs on the floor represent traps. Open to any constructive criticism! Not usually an artist, so I know I still have a lot to learn.
Hello I'm the Elven Tower guy :) I saw this post by sheer luck. Thanks for sharing a link to my site, I really appreciate it.Your map looks good to me, even more since it's the first one. Isometric is not easy on the brain. 
Some parts of it are a bit more obscuring of other elements than they should be, but I really like the style of it.  Good job!
Looks awesome! I just started drawing dungeons with isometric paper too. There is a sub dedicated to it at r/IsometricDnD
It looks great!One thing I can't not see is that your little square divisions make it look like all the floor is pillow. Which actually sounds like an interesting idea...
Wtf it looked upside down and I blinked and now it's not and my brain hurts. Whatever way up it's supposed to be it looks really good. 
Reminds me of Habbo Hotel
Fuckin gay, I love it
Dude, that looks so cool! I normally draw like I'm drafting when doing a dungeon. I like the almost video game like level design. 
That's great!
 flip it upside down and it still makes sense...
Great job!!!!
It looks great, but i would note in the future boxy and square shaped rooms arent strong enough to hold up underground and would collapse. try a more vaulted ceiling look for a little touch of realism. Either way great work
That‚Äôs an awesome idea!
Clean
It's great.  I fucking love isometric dungeon drawings!
This is going to make my brain explode! Love it üòÄ
Very cool!
This is baller
Love that graph paper 
That looks nice, though I am a bit disappointed. I read dragon, not dungeon and found your dragon to be rather odd looking.
I think fuck you for being way more talented than I am. Also it looks awesome. 
Rulers are your friend
Reminds me of Runescape 
Id sat, for a first time, Its pretty awesome. I do drawings like that on a Daily bacis, and it could be better, but awesome for sure
Holy shit this is cool
Use a ruler.
Looks great! I wish i could make maps this great for my games.
What is the paper that you used called?Anyway I can get a template to print out?Thanks!EDIT:Just occurred to me, it's called Isometric paper lol... I was searching for diagonal square/maths paper...
Your perspective needs a little work but it's better than Hitler's. 
Jesus Christ thats good üëç
Reminds me of diablo but idk why
I would legitimately play dnd with you just to play on these isometric worlds you create. 
I think it would be easier if you learned how to use CAD
Is this based on CoD Black Ops 1 map? My friend says it reminds her of Verruckt or Kinerdetoten(sp) but is having a hard time finding a good image to compare it with
The best part is the owl's reaction

Looks like the owl is saying:"Bitch please!"
That's funny how the apple tries to imitate the owl.

This needs more upvotes. Nobody has ever cut an apple into an owl while a Superbowl is there to pose with it
he looks so offended
I was gonna shout HEDWIG then the bottom half of the pic loaded
The owl looks like he's looking at someone saying, "what is this motherfucker doing holding an apple above my head for?" 
He's like "I see what you did there".
The owls are not what they seem

This iz mai rock collection.  Some day I will have many moor rocks but right now i only hav two.
This is a Leopard Gecko. Their mouths are all shaped like this naturally.They are naturally adorable.
He must have saved 15% or more. 
Happy lil doot doot :)
One rock for youOne rock for meBecause gecko is friendAnd friendship is free
Shout out to /r/leopardgeckos they're super easy to keep and are naturally very adorable. If you spend some time learning the basics on how to care for them they make a great buddy!
Awwww, he's adorable!!! Seriously though, this melted my heart and made me smile... something I needed today. Thank you :)
I want to boop the snoot.
Awww!! My gecko was smilin at me the other day too. So cute. 
That's a cool little dude
I may get an additional leopard gecko now. Thanks.
He didn't pay a lot for car insurance
This cute lil fren would look stunning with eyelashes. 
I just love that little guy!  Our leopard gecko, as do probably ALL leopard geckos, has that same adorable smile!
Those eyes.
Do Gecko's normally look this cute and happy?
Jesus he looks like he could be straight out of a Pixar film. So cute!
15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car insurance

I had a leopard gecko "Hiss" for about 12 years. Was the best pet, very durable. I accidentally sat on him at least once and other than squeezing the shit out of him he was fine. It was my bitch cat that ruined everything. :'(  He enjoyed climbing humans and getting his head petted. The only issues we had were sometimes when he would shed, the skin on the tips of his fingers wouldn't come off, which caused one of his fingers to fall off. I think this can be solved by gently rubbing some hydrogen peroxide on a q-tip on the affected fingers. They have a long lifespan for a gecko, and it's one of the only geckos that have eye lids that close. When you get them as babies they may Hiss at you as a defense mechanism, but with time, attention and human contact they will warm up to you and become a wonderful little pet. Just keep your cats away!
Smug bastard. Look at him, sitting all cute!
Once I take this rock I'll have two rocks. Then only one more to go...
u/randomosaur
It's kinda creepy how he's like the same color as human skin...
I wonder what it was thinking at that moment.
He's smiling... 
Cutest thing I saw today :-)
Ptes dd r.      Yeah qQqqqss
He is smiling! I want to hug him!
Some 20 years ago I worked at a pet shop with a huge tank full of leopard geckos. Super pretty little buggers, however super bitey, and fast as lightning. 
He is adorable!! 
How your girl looks when didn't bring her any food. 
Leos are just the best!  I‚Äôve had mine (a rescue named Alexander) for about a month.  He‚Äôs given me an extra reason the get out of bed in the morning.  Love that little dude.  https://imgur.com/gallery/etVGT
Or, you know - just "a gecko". That "happy" part is just people anthropo... oh why do I bother. Cute pic though.
Oh this makes me kinda sad. There's a gecko who lives in my bathroom and I haven't seen him in 5 days. Getting worried. 
I immediately trust him with my life.

Wait who was that woman in the wave? Go back explain that part!
Half way through the wave is that another person under the water? Her reflection is in the wave and then suddenly and briefly there is something else. Am I imagining it? Edit: Just watched again, it‚Äôs another girl with a camera. Maybe that‚Äôs the girl with the future you were talking about. Both women impressive. Would love to see what footage the woman under the water got.
She sure does look like she's enjoying herself. 
I have never surfed... but it amazes me and she is did a FANTASTIC job with her GoPro. 
Yes the person in the wave was filming her surfing. Check out red bull tv on playstation or xbox to see some surfing footage from ‚Äúinside the water‚Äù and you can take my updoot OP!
Her Instagram if you care about that sort of thing: www.instagram.com/flickpalmateer
That‚Äôs called a gimbal.
Looks so damn fun.
Her smile is one of pure joy. 
As someone terrified of the ocean it baffles be that she just jumps in at the end.

I watched Rocket Power. Nothing about this is impressive.
I don't see the words "camera woman" and "has a future" together very often..
I worked on this ship when my old company sent me to retrofit the boilers, engine room controls, and sensors awhile ago. When u walk through u can‚Äôt believe ur on a ship, looks like a hospital inside.  Ship with hatch‚Äôs and ladders then bam hospital hallways. 
My cousin's wife is the chief nurse on this ship. Fair winds and following seas. 
‚ÄúFloating hospital ship‚Äù. As opposed to the other non-floating hospital ships. 
Realistically, what can this ship do for the current situation in PR? They allready have supplies but no way to distribute them properly. Plus I thought hospitals on PR were still open.
Theres a hospital ship? Til
Its amazing that such a thing as this ship exists! It would be even more amazing if people could just appreciate what we can do instead of using everything as an excuse to be bitter and nasty. Ill take the ship over that though!
The whole concept of a moving hospital is fantastic 
Just a reminderhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/09/26/clinton-pressured-trump-to-deploy-hospital-ship-comfort-to-puerto-rico-now-its-on-the-way/Although to be fair, maybe it would have been deployed anyway
And the comfort should be there within a few days of cruise :)
This is great but why did it take this long for the Jones act to be waived?
So, after 30 days will they bring the ship back since it will be running out or supplies or will it be re-supplied in PR? 
My first thought as a former Corpsman was why didn't they already have one of these hospital ships over there right after? During Katrina, I was doing nothing on base, just a bit of training here and there, yet they needed people like me bad and they didn't send us. Nothing has changed. 
Glad to see this is finally underway
I read that as SNES Comfort floating hospital.
Thanks Clinton
Check out this AMA of someone who works on these ships. https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/73c2xl/iama_sailor_with_over_10_years_on_board_the_us/
Send the Bataan too.  LHD5 was one of the first responders to 9/11 and was the main hospital ship before Comfort arrived in harbor.  It has one of the better medical facilities afloat and was utilized as an overflow facility once Comfort arrived.  Plus, it can bring a full compliment of Seabees with their kit to start construction.
Oh nice only took ten days..
I wish we still had a base at Roosevelt Roads
After days and days just chilling in Virginia. The delay was intentional.
Its about freaking time. Why wasn't that there the day after the hurricane struck? They had 5 days notice that the hurricane was coming..
Good job President Trump!!!!
Oh thank god will those guys shut up now?They hated us before, they hate us now, and they'll hate us in the future.There is literally no way we could be on their good side. A lot of them think we've raped them economically for 100's of years, if not further raping.The supplies are LITERALLY sitting on their docks, and we have tons of assets in the area. It's not like they are right next door.. fuck.Yes, you might have to walk outside your front door to get your free water and rice.FFS
I hope there are no wacky IJN submarines out there who don't know that the war is over.Also, [this advert on the artivle, haha oh goodness](https://imgur.com/KkITPBj)
Pharmacy most important imo.
hmm. how long before it arrives?
Finally, everyone's been asking why this wasn't there a week ago considering it was just sitting in port doing nothing. 
While this is great news the ship should have been prepared and sent immediately after the storm hit 
I can't believe they did't send it out the moment the hurricane was past. It took far too long.
Fucking *finally*!
We got this ship but we can't figure out healthcare?  WTF 
It's really unfortunate that it's going to take a *week* for them to arrive. Why weren't they sent out, oh, I don't know, right away?!
A week too lateJust another presidential fail by cheeto trump 
Was no one else concerned that the ship departed from "Virgina"? Don't down vote me... Down vote the guy who can't proof read his online news articles! 
It would have been uplifting if they arrived sooner.  Now it's just further indication of tbe buffoonery of the current US regime.
Better late than never 
Dr ee
USS comfort? Really?
HEADING?  Why not "already there and providing care since the hurricane was like four months ago."Four months.

Wishful thinking. I miss futurama 
Damn you, Netflix. Put the good ones back on.
I could hear the theme song music in my head while I watched this 
As someone who studied 3D motion graphics this is insanely well done. So much work went into this.  Thank you for posting.
I want to watch this. Shut up and take my money!
"In Hypno-Vision"
For ease of enjoyment:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRk1s5Kf3aQ
Yeah I'd definitely like to live there.
This is gorgeous
Well this is fucking glorious 
Must be JJ Abrams, with all that fucking lens flare.
I couldn't make this, so my advice is obviously to be taken with a grain of salt, but damn, if you're gonna end it with the ship flying by, end it with the ship flying into the screen, like the show. But from the screen's perspective. 
Very cool looking, but I wouldn't want to see the series remade like this. An episode like *[Reincarnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation_\(Futurama\))* would be neat though.
I am a leaf on the wind
i want to go to there
Need a Futurama movie!
I was hoping they would hit a giant TV
I would play the fuck outta a game like this
I have never wanted a Futurama game more than I do right now.
Fun Fact: The futurama theme song was a remastering of ["Psych√© Rock"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKz4qVmUz84), a 1967 track by [Pierre Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Henry) who was a pioneer in electronic music. 
Damn!! They should make a movie with this CGI
Since the series is over (and I don't want it back, the ending was perfect), I would love a video game. This looks amazing!
good news everyone!
Must.know.where.this.is.from.asap. Futurama.withdrawals.already.in.progress.
Awesome rendering, but why not Zoidberg?
How is this not a video game?
Directed by Joss Whedon.
This is absolutely stunning.
who else played the music in their head watching this
Damn, this is beautiful.
Futurama theme song. Followed by Nixon head. Followed by...This moment brought to you by Charleston Chew
This is fantastic, thank you OP
This needs to happen. I would pay for this.
I imagine pretty much everybody hears the theme song in their head while watching this. 
I'm disappointed in Reddit. The top rated comment should be the Fry meme of "Shut up and take my money." Does this count?
Neat
This is so wonderful
All the upvotes to whoever adds the soundtrack to this
You can't watch this without humming the tune.
 This is amazing!
Wow, the time and dedication put into making this is outstanding. I especially love the ads on the buildings, and the busyness of the city.The attention to detail is so great, and the things he gets right on are amazing, but the things that go wrong, go really wrong. Those spiral buildings are just bad, they are not present in any scenes during the opening credits, or the show. It just looks like a 3d render of a spiral made from rectangles and the amount of those buildings taking screen time really sucks because I love the overall feel of this clip so much.
I want this and I'm sure if there is enough support, we can get this. Make this post as popular as you can.
That camera zoom and focus made me miss Firefly.
I need this in my life or I might die..
Amazing work! I would pay anything to see this as a  game. Flying around on the Planet Express ship and delivering weird cargo planet to planet. Trying not to get killed by everything in the universe.
did jj abrams make it, sheesh
This looks awesome! Just one tiny note though. If you could make the planet express ship tilt into its turns, maybe have it wobble a little like its actually flying then this would be absolutely perfect 
More like meet the Robinsons, am I right
I got stuck on the water and the bay. 
Is suck a dick for this to be a real movie/show/anything longer 
Absolutely amazing
Make it so
This is so beautiful! 
Ooooh---looks expensive!
Awesome
I wanna see the entire intro like this
Good news everyone, this gave me a boner
Bring it back!  Bring it back, Bring it back!
Damn, that's cool. When you set up 3d stuff like this, do you only add details to the sides that are going to be shown in the shot? Like, if we viewed this same scene from "the opposite end" would there be blank surfaces and hollow stuff?
What is this wizardry?
Leela in 3D, puleeeeze?  You know, for science.
More!
I might give 6 months of my life to see this as a movie.
Yes. Yes! YES! 
This is gorgeous.
If looks like ratchet and clank. 
I want more!!
Ive seen a few episodes of futurama but the humor just didn't stick with me. Am I missing something? Because everyone seems to think this show is like the greatest shit since sliced bread.
Wow this is mesmerizing. 
Looks so freaking good!
Reminds me of Columbia.
What is this and how do I fund it?
Why oh why hasn't there been a Futurrama movie?!!!!!!
Dun, Dun Dun, Dun, Dun; Din Dun Dun, Din Din Din Dun.
Please make this for VR someday...
Fantastic. But I don't see the Bachelor Chow ad?
They should totally make a 3D animation of Futurama as a movie 
This looks like ratchet and clank
https://gifsound.com/?gifv=bIHfKtC&v=pkO1u2hrwxA
Directed by JJ Abrams.
The movie we did know we needed
Now do Rick and Morty 3d...
I'm hiring you to make us about 6 new, old or rehashed episodes in this fashion.  I will admit that I have nothing to pay you with other than my undying gratitude for making something so fucking awesome.
My computer busted a nut just thinking about the render time
The theme song was playing in my head
sweet..._asks for recreation of the intro_
maybe in the year 3k we'll have a futurama reboot.if only.
I will say this very good to look at. The one thing I will critique is if possible make the ship do a bank turn so it doesn't look so stiff.
OP, you're Alexey Zakharov? Source and additional art from the artist: https://www.behance.net/gallery/18362139/FUTURAMA-3D-part-1
Video was posted 3 years ago. So they probably have a full minute of footage now
Imagine they could use the model for VR then travel through the transport tubes through the city.
Anyone else heard the intro music in their head while watching? 
Already better than The Orville 
Omfg. Fantastic work. Kudos to the creator
I wish there was a game
This. Must. Happen.
Source?   
That is sofa king booty full!
Need more lens flare
DuuuudeDuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuudeThisIsFuckinAwwweeessssoooommmmeeeeeeeee
Wait... No billboard crash?
before WALL-E'S time
I'm... really disappointed it didn't end with the billboard crash...
Why are we not finding this to be a movie?!
Is this the new 3D Mark demo?
r/Futurama would appreciate this. 
Heard the theme song playing like a hanz Zimmer symphony on steroids in my head whilst watching this. So epic, thanks for the share
I would frickin LOVE if this was made into a quality live action tv show or movie. 
Albeit exciting, this gives me some sort of anxiety going on...
Ok who just looked at that and DIDN'T have the opening notes to the theme song go through their heads?
[Shut up and take my money!](https://i.imgur.com/WYdb1WX.jpg)
I miss 
Was this made in unity 3d?
Sure that looks amazing. But how would the characters look in that kind of brilliant 3D design? I'm thinking weird. 
Futurama is 3d isn't it, at least the backgrounds, just with different shaders.
I wish I could use this as a looping background on my phone.  Awesome job!
Damn this really makes you think how New New York would really be
I don‚Äôt think I could watch those depressing episodes again in this level of detail 
Wouldn't the spaceship bank instead of just looking like it's on rails? I think the addition of a slight rotation when it's turning would make it seem real.
*DINGDINGDENENE DENDENDENENEDEN BAPPA BAAAA*
I don't see a single billboard being crashed into
Wish this was an endless loop so i could use it as a desktop with wallpaper engine.
Remarkable work!  Although, I did expect the ship to crash into the camera.
Don't tease me baby. 
And here I was thinking it was gonna crash into a TV screen lol
I wish
Why... Why tease us?!Honestly I'm not sure the entire show would work as well redone like this. I'm intrigued but thinking about it, the cartoon basics of it really worked with it. Maybe had I NOT seen it before, maybe. That aside. This does look amazing.
The zoom-in/in and out of focus manual camera thing was very Battlestar Galactica. 
Ok so live action who would play who?
/r/noisygifs
this is pretty indistinguishible from the Star Wars prequels.
This feels a lot like Firefly
They should make this a show
Last time this was posted, people mentioned how this looks really cool for objects and stuff. But it would be weird to see uncartooned futurama characters (like MOM up there). 
Tbh the ship should bank alongside the turn to make it less dull looking
See that city? That's what I thought Prey 2 was going to be like after that one trailer. Sons of bitches.
Where's bachelor chow?
Wheres the rest?  Its cutting out before it hits the billboard 
Robots 2? 
A passing space/aircraft ruffling a camera has become awful visual cliche.
The ship have hit the camera
To me it seems overly complex. Like he became so obsessed with the details that he couldn't see the city for the buildings
Shut up and take my money!
This is Great. Good even. The best news.
Hate to be that guy, but there is definitely something off with the size / distance of the shipEspecially noticeable when passing in front of the tower, looks like it goes through or something, right ?
The same gif but with music and sound effectshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUUNu88HYqY
this is pretty rad, super cool, what Futurama could be now . damn i miss that show.  
Is this why they haven't put any new episodes out? Please tell me that this is why they haven't put any new episodes out. 
This is absolutely gorgeous!
Awesome!
Can anybody add those white lines?
i miss this show a lot
Yes plz
Awesome. Great show. Miss it." Bite my shiny metal ass!"
Needs more motion blur, glare and lens flares, I can still kind of tell that it's supposed to be Futurama.
good news everyone!
Live action futurama. If done correctly with original comedy it would be amazing. 
Someone get this onto Wallpaper Engine, quick!
For some reason I feel like I needed this. Thanks for sharing. 
Aahhh I forgot my 2D goggles 
Add some bank to that ship
If this is some fan made bs I'm gonna be pissed. Very impressed but very pissed.
Don‚Äôt tease me like this!!!
I've lost count how many times this has been posted.
Unreal engine?
When Futurama premiered it's intro was *cutting edge* 3D CGI that was all the rage at SIGGRAPH that year along with OpenGL and Java.
Hnnnng
I would be absolutely blown away by a reboot of futurama in this aesthetic. Incredible!
Is there any way to make this into a looping desktop background? Because this would be perfect as one.
Someone put the theme to this please.
Did anyone else hear that damn catchy theme song just watching this??
Wait. Is this real?
üîî.üîîüîî.üîî.üîî....üîî.üîî.üîî.
Holy macaroni!
Futurama vr 
It's beautiful
I can just hear the opening theme
When is this going to be an open world game. Anything really.
STOP. GETTING. MY HOPES UP!!!!!!
Needs more lens flare
Who did this? J.J. Abrams? Because that lens flare...
I can hear the intro music in my head as I watch this.
Wank swanson
I. LOVE. THIS.
This is awesome.... but what's with all these lens flares?  Is this like Abrams Star Trek?
Why tho
Looks like some sick Ratchet and Clank dlc.
I‚Äôd watch this 
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY! I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE!
Almost any frame could be used as some sick wallpaper, on mobile right now but will try tomorrow 
Huhwhaaa?
Yay eye candy!
Mom's Old Fashioned Lens Flare
Take my money 
No it's not. This is an ancient render.
I can hear the music
The video game must be made.
what make this a videogame i will preorder
Futurama Road Rage would be a great game!
Too much HDR, eyes bleeding, I looked straight at it.
I need to see more... pleeeease... fox or preferably comedy central Gods. HEEEAAAR MY PRAYERS!
Good thing we didn't see the characters in 3D. From what I see whenever they try to make animated characters in 3D, it's always haunting. Like, nightmarish haunting.Edit: Spelling
I'm curious about something. When making something like this, are you making true 3D models, or just the illusion of 3D from this angle? Meaning, could you move the camera around this city, looking at the backside etc. I know the lighting and skybox might not be designed to look good from all angles, but the city itself is what I am wondering about.
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!! Really though... that is absolutely amazing and I suddenly have a new great hope in my life.  Ha. 
This is absolutely incredible. Wow great work. 
Live action movie when?
#MOTHERFUCKING LENS FLARESGtfo cheap scifi-producer jj abrams' alt account :')
Wow.... This is unbelievable! So good!
Fantastic. Couldn't help but hear the theme in my head as I watched it.I do wish it would have had the Planet Express ship crashing into a billboard, though. 
I want futurama VR
Wow. This is incredibly well done. 
I would love if they remade Futurama Episodes in 3d. Just not Jurassic Bark.
Looks straight out of Ratchet and Clank
Boss lens flare. 
Just finished watching Smart House and Leila is the house!
I'm disappointed by the lack of maths jokes in this, but other than that, it's absolutely glorious.
This is so amazing :( I love futurama
Oh my fucking god, feels like a dream, i need this in my life
Omg it's beautiful 
Wow, that's awesome! I love it! Have you tried tilting the ship inwards in its initial turn? I think that would make it look even better :) 
r/futurama
Nice
i dont like it, the ship didnt crash
Yes please!
Not enough zoidberg 
fuck yes
Just do what Jimmy and Timmy did and repeat the same thing three fucking times
Wow, this is so amazing. 
This is awesome
it's so dense! Every single image has so much going on!
Please make this scene into a wallpaper engine wallpaper!!
I feel like if they ever did a 3D episode they would just spend half the episode referencing it.
Wow that is ridiculously awesome! 
Its official We need a movie
Please turn this into a game!
When you zoomed in, I was like oh [shit!!](https://giphy.com/gifs/food-ahead-upcoming-Lcn0yF1RcLANG/fullscreen)
I love futurama
Titleless: unexpected.Great job!
Funny how depictions of the future are always seen with people living on top of one another in very crowded cities. Cool video, though!
Holy shitR/futurama for a ton of karma

Houli has got to be the Norm Smith right? was huge in the first half when he was needed
Booing walker. Real fucking classy. 
I think that's the record for Crouch for disposals in a season.
[deleted]
Last year: Damien Hardwick was almost sackedThis year: Damien Hardwick is a Premiership winning coach
GG Crows. 100% deserved to be here today. See you next year <3.
Fade the flairs :( 
There is no way Dusty deserves the Norm Smith.
I'm sorry Crows fans. This is too good, I'm crying
Crows will win
Has the reputation of a coach ever turned around so quickly?
fuck its actually happened
GO TIGES
I'm glad I've adopted Richmond as a second home after Freo
Richmond just don't deserve it
You know what, It's proably time for me to stop watching footy for a bit...
Still not 100% convinced that Tigers are the real deal if I'm honest
FUCK R/ALL IS INVADING
The plus side is that we've saved hundreds of dollars that would have otherwise been spent on celebratory merchandise.
ONE FUCKIN MINUTE BOYS
Richo crying, must have missed a mark again
I reckon Tim Watson will be hugging Richo while he weeps in a minute 
I hope Dusty wins the Norm Smith so I can at least see a bit of history out of the worst finals series of all time.
Wtf are they chipping it around for? PERCENTAGE BOYS
Boy, you'd think Richmond have got it from here
Remember when Richmond lost by 113 points in the last round a year ago? Fuck me sideways. Lions for premiers 2018
I'm actually crying and I don't even support them. 
Fuck me the onions. 
Richo must have had a bet on the Crows...
Oh Richo ‚ô•Ô∏è
#BETTS. WAS. HELD.
Umps put the whistle away, they want it to be over as well
Actual attendance 100043. 22 Adelaide players also spectating today. Tigers a class above today 
It is the point of the GF when I realise that this means no footy for a long time :C
That was the crows cleanest possession all day
FUCK R/ALL
I think this is the alcohol talking, but...GG Tiges. Much too good on the day. I'm stoked for your club as well,Oh Adelaide, I'm so heartbroken but still proud after everything you've been through

Please give the normsith to Ellis 
"I cant imagine whats gunna happen in richmond tonight"  let me fucking tell ya   a lot of cocaine and beer   i mean   A LOT of cocaine and beer
Next goal is worth 50 points. 
St Kilda's turn the break the drought next. 
Dusty just glad for the 4 points
Surely not Dusty for the Normie, gotta be Houli or Rance. 
Richmond winning does seem like the right ending to this fucking weird season.
3 whole seats unfilled. Piss poor effort
DYNAMITE

H U M A  N M  E  A  T  B A  L L  
It would piss me off so much if Dusty won the Norm Smith. No way he's been BoG
Dusty looks a lot like Eminem. 
I can't wait for the whole crowd to burst into tears at the of the game üòÇ
C'mon Crows, 8 goals in 2 and a half minutes!!!
Phrases you didn't expect to hear for Grand Final commentary: "human meatball" 
Cmon boys, 26th on r/all. Keep going
Guys, we're gonna have to start conceding that Richmond are genuine flag chances after this performance.
Honestly I've no idea who will get the Norm Smith. Houli and Rance won the game in the first half but the second half was such a flogging they didn't need to do much.
Doggies are still the reigning premiers 
Astbury for Norm Smith
**Hold me. Hold me tight.** 
The human meatball!
The Human Meatball
Whenever anyone saying I'm dreaming if I think St Kilda can win a flag, I'll show them the last two Grand Finals. 
score rn? v2
Bulldogs fans, enjoy being the current champions for 3 more minutes.
List of things to be grateful for for Crows fans- At least we made the grand final- Life is short and the pain we experience ceases to have ever existed upon our death- Ty Vickery still hasn't won a Premiership
Sydney couldn't give Nank a premiership but we got you fam!!!
Glad the warm up act for the killers concert is nearly over, come on Mr bright side
happy i bet on that 40+ go tigs!!!!!!
BOYS... IM GETTING RUGBY LEAGUE DRUNK TONIGHT!
Best regular season in recent history. Worst finals series in recent history.
Still reckon Adelaide could have won today if they stopped sooking and gave up 2x 1st round picks for Gibbs. Thats what being stingy gets u, a Grand Final loss because you're unwilling to take a chance on a borderline AA player who could have helped you.
Dimma won one too at Hawthorn, Bruce, although I understand that you're not counting assistants
Better start a gofundme for Mick Molloy's liver transplant 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=a028f9WiaPk
Never thought this day would come. 
7 calling the result 5 minutes early...
I never thought I would see the day of Richmond winning the Premiership....
Can I just ask that supporters in this thread get on the AFL page after this and talk down everyone who blames the umpires for the Richmond win.YES Adelaide have been hard done by. But no, we can't say THAT is the difference between why Adelaide have lost by this margin. Surely not. Adelaide struggled through the 2nd and 3rd quarters. Not the umps fault.
FUCK EVERYONE WHO SAID WE ARE SHIT WE FUCKING SMASHED EVERYONE WE PLAYED IN FINALS
Bachar deserves the normsmith because he was best when it counted, dusty got a lot of junk time stats 
This commentary is nauseating.Talk about the footy until the game is over FFS
Hotel industry going to have a fucking riot tonight.
All I'm saying is Adelaide fans, Cameron and a 1st rounder for Gibbs. Who says no?
Imagine Waleed Aly's speech when Houli gets the Norm
Well done tiggies
Richmond the reigning prems of 2018, buckle up for next year its going to be a wild ride   
Isn't this going to be the biggest average winning margin finals series now. Provided the margin stays near 50
It seems like Adelaide have been accidentally playing on all game
...could you at least try to look happy you got a goal? :(
The memes make me want to believe but it's the hope that hurts the most. 
amazing you can't hear a single cheer when the crows kick a goal
60 odd to 100 odd. Fuck you 2015 flashbacks. 
If Richmond Richmond this, I'll become a Hawks supporter. 
FiveAA will be in tears today.
Dusty haircut incoming 
Second GF in a row that gives the AFL exactly what they want.
4:20
After 3 years of Hawthorn winning everything, surely we need 3 years of feel good stories. What i'm trying to say is Pls Melbourne next year.
Half the state is dancing around their living rooms, Bruce.
Fuck it's quiet.  All the crowd are at the airport already
literally no cheer for that goal lmao
COTCHIN SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED
Well done Tiges :)
/r/nankmemes 
Genuinely hope punt road gets nuked

This is almost sad to watch
Richmond have been the better team today, but I don't believe they've been this big a margins worth of a better team. Believe what you want, Umps have definitely had an impact on this game, in a decent wayEdit: at least 4 bad calls that have ended in either ended in Richmond goals or stopped Adelaide goals, and that's not a 'clear impact'?
What Adelaide need now is to kick a goal
Yellow and Black shout in the song is gonna be something. 
Tex has had one of the shittest grand finals for a captain.
Have fun in Melbourne Lever
How and why do you still boo tex when you're 50 pts up
Will Adelaide keep their power stance in the future?
Looks like Mark Riccuito will end up being right about a 10-goal margin at very least.  :-P
NANK THE TANK!
NANK THE SOVIET TANK
Justin Leppitsch must be quite happy right now
IM WANKING FOR YOU NANK
NANK THE TANK
Weren't Adelaide the highest scoring team this season? 54 points is pretty poor.
NANKTHETANK
THE DARK DAYS ARE FUCKING OVER
Why does everyone boo tex? Any reason?
So many coach killers from the crows today. 
DUSTY TO BE THE FIRST PLAYER TO NOT ONLY WIN THE BROWNLOW & PREMIERSHIP IN THE SAME YEARBUT ALSO THE FIRST TO POSSIBLY WIN THE BROWNLOW, NORMSMITH & PREMIERSHIP IN 1 YEAR!!!!
That was the weirdest stat of all time by Bruce. First tigers player to win the bronwlow and premiership in the same year? Surely that's no that crazy
It's not too late Crows, quick grab the Cup and get on the bus!
Carn the Tiges. The Tiggy Train is chugging along. 
Eddie Betts for a last 5 minutes goal!
Are we all have ready to go off our nut in 5 minutes
SHOW THE GAME YOU CUNTS.
Get out of the box and down to the bench Dimma! Give your boys some hugs!
I think Dusty might have won the Norm with that goal.
Bruce forgetting about Aker and Black. 
Crowd attendance?
Crows gettin schooled - RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME!
So much for the away strip curse.
GUYS BETTS WAS HELD
Hardwick get down to the bench son
We all love you Mick and Richo.
Adelaide made the mistake of not having David Mundy on their team
"Hey siri, what's a nifty suicide method?" Me rn
So sweet
I'M NOT CRYING
Felt like Dusty's has a quiet game today. Obviously wasn't bad just wasn't his absolute best
So the official capacity is 100,024, so there are 3 empty seats out there somewhere?
New to afl here guys but what time does this practice game end and grand final start? 
Masterful second half by Richmond. Any contentious calls don't excuse not turning up in the third and fourth. 
Cant wait for the boos when Hird awards the medal. 
DUSTY MARTIN GOAT üêêüêØüèÜ
 Bruce is rambling
ooo you correct yourself Bruce. I was about to call you out, sir.
How do you even find the spirit to keep playing as an Adelaide player? I rage quit if I'm a few goals down in rocket league..
Brayshaw; "What?! WHAT?!"Great commentary.
PUBS ANGRY AND ILL FIGHT THEM ALLGO THE FUCKING TIGERS!!!!!!
I'm so happy for Richmond

100,000?!?! Jesus, I don‚Äôt know many North American stadiums that can hold that?!

Actually in tears, we are going to win a grand final :')
Ok, controversial, but I'm calling it
Houli is being robbed by Bruce
Good game, Tiges - you never want to lose a premiership, but if we're going down, I can't think of a more deserving team to be defeated by, on or off the field.
Well, I'm glad we (along with Port) gave us one good final this year. You're welcome AFL!
Dusty wins the norm smith and I'm getting his haircut. 
Junktime
Pretty sure they have Bruce
That guy looks like he could be Prestia's dad
Bruce making up bullshit facts right there.
So then she just started "taking"my popcorn! I mean can you believe.....
Those are the decoy agents. The other 5 real agents are dressed normally.
thats a weird pic actually. the crowd around him were all making an effort to look away while they were doing the photo op. but they all looked in random different directions into the sky.
Look at Obama's eyes and smile.  It looks like what he's being told is secretly horrifying him but he's trying to be nice about it
If we don't look into the camera then the camera can't see us.
Ridiculously photogenic former president
Obama looks genuinely happy. 
This is at the invictus games if anyone is wondering about the context. It's a competition for disabled veterans
Jill Biden is getting a serious manspreading hug from Joe and POTUS here.
What is it with the leg room of the men? The woman in front barely had any room in her own seat!

I‚Äôd have a worse look if I was on the detail protecting those assholes 
Was the game that bad that everyone was looking away? 
Is that Joe Lieberman?
Look How relaxed they are. Wasn't the same with M. Trump.
So I see the Invictus Games t-shirt in the backround which is currently going on in Toronto... Did Obama and Joe come to Canada without telling meh D:?
Fuck Prince Harry. Done nothing to be there other than his mum fucked the queen's son.
Why new ruler does not simply imprison war monger Barack Obasma?

Racism is so American, that when an American is being racist, they are being patriotic.
Kind of like how Trump is so fascist that his supporters assume anyone who protests fascism is protesting trump. [case in point](https://www.google.com/amp/amp.fox23.com/news/trending-now/donald-trump-supporters-upset-after-npr-tweets-quotes-from-declaration-of-independence/550573377) 
Damn this post triggered a lot of people. Anyone that wasn‚Äôt triggered didn‚Äôt even bother commenting.
*sort by controversial*
Truth.
I like to see material posted from here to Facebook, not the other way around.
God this is so stupid
Tell that to BritainFirst. 
"Humor"
How is sitting during the national anthem protesting racism? How is it protesting anything other than America, the one thing the national anthem represents?
It is my contention (laugh all you want) that in general, Americans are NOT racist. Prejudice (like we all are)? Sure. But true racism is the exception and not the rule. Hence the reason a lot of Americans get upset and insulted when constantly being told they are racist. 
Haha. I like this post so much. 
How is this horribly unfunny political humor subreddit constantly on the front page of reddit?
The people who started this protest are multimillionaires with legions of screaming fans, whose success comes from playing a game. Some of them skate right out of high school. They're focusing their protests on the flag, and the national anthem. This, in the wake of movements whose public message frequently seems to impugn all white people for everything that any person of minority status has ever suffered.   There are people out there acting like we've regressed since the mid-20th century. They're the minority. They're also very vocal, and they tend to be opposed to moderate measures.   I've come around since the current series of protests started. The protest is clearly effective. It's got people talking about an issue that exists. Everyone has the right to protest in any case, but I initially held a negative opinion due to the points I've already made. You can't visibly protest America as part of the 0.1%, then say "LOL racists" to literally everybody who objects on those grounds. That's no better than anything being said to the protesters themselves. 
Racism is so American, that people from all over the world come here to be racist.
Racism in America is a social construct set up by those in power who are afraid to lose that power. It's a divide and conquer tactic to keep people distracted, weak and afraid. There are a lot less racist people in the states than you might think.Racism doesn't just exist in America though, although I think it's a different kind of racism compared to say Asia where it's more cultural based.  But hell some places encourage skin bleaching to promote status, I've never seen that promoted in the states. So I don't feel it's a fair statement to say "racism is so American." It's more like racism "is so human"Edit: Has anyone read past the first sentence of my comment? Or is this sub just a big "everyone is racist " circle jerk? Edit2: Okay got it, circle jerk. I don't get how this post is humorous. It's just calling America racist for the sake of calling America racist. 
No people think that because you are protesting the national anthem lol.If you were protesting Katy Perry singing the superbowl halftime show nobody would think you were protesting Muricah. 
I still don't see that kneeling for the national anthem is anti racism? If anything it's disrespectful to your boss, who asked you to stand, your team and your country. How a privileged black man feels he has to do it is beyond me. How much money has Kapaernic earned off white owners, off his white parents who adopted and raised him? At the end of the day, the media turned it into an Anti-Trump affair and lost, again. 
Another knee-slapper from this hilarious thread /s 
Im sorry, i can't hear you over the sound of our flag being shit on.
Now, I have to disagree with this, at least in the context I believe the statement is made in, assuming it is about the whole NFL Bs. The reason people are angry and believe it's "disrespectful to America" is because it's during the anthem. The anthem is not racist. People aren't angry about the protest, they're angry that it's taking place during the anthem. Most people I've talked about this with couldn't care less about the actual protest, they're angry about the lack of respect for the anthem which represents the country. 
What exactly is everybody protesting I seriously have no idea
United States of hate 
Yeah no this is so stupid.  When you kneel during our NATIONAL ANTHEM then we KNOW that you are DISRESPECTING our nation and the values that we stand for.
Who is this quoting? 
I thought I was on /r/TumblrInAction for a second. This is an amazing strawman. 
Well, that solidifies this sub as evil. I only ever see trash here, but with this one I thought surely it would be impossible for people to straightforwardly go along with something so profoundly false on two levels. Nope.
And all text memes are so facebook when I complain about it people will think I'm complaining about reddit something something
Probably because it's happening during the Anthem...
Uhm...if you're kneeling for the anthem and the flag you're the one conflating America with racism. 
Africans are the real racists, go to any African country as a white person and you will be dead soon unless you are lucky. I lived in Zimbabwe for nearly a decade but I had to leave as they were trying to kill me because I am white.
Who's the average American?
Censorism is American.
I think its more like tribalism is so prevalent in cities that a small number if people think everything is about racism. You dont disrespect the flag and call it anything but misguided 
Protesting personal opinions. Way to think it through. Why not protest brussel sprouts, too? 
The only people who conflate America and racism are the ones who protest racism by refusing to stand for the flag
What racism are you guys protesting?
FUCK WHITE PEOPLE!

For what possible reason was the bottom right picture edited like that?
The phone affects the water on a cellular level.  
Does this work with iPhones 
So if I put too many phones in do I have to add more water? 
What's up guys, Tech Rax here, today I'm flying a drone into a pool full of rice that's also full of brand new iPhone 8s
What I'd like to know is why was the bottom right picture blatantly photoshopped?    Actually, it looks more like it was done in Microsoft Paint. What gives?
I've seen this many times and only just realized its edited badly
Is this loss.jpg?
iPhoneX: 1/10IPhoneX with rice: 5/10IPhoneX still sucks, but at least I get rice.
This is a bad call.
I've always heard if your phone was wet, put it in a bowl of rice and stick it in the fridge.The Asians will come in the middle of the night and fix it.
So by the transitive property, if your phone has too much rice in it... put it in water!
Does this work if i microwave my rice?
If you put too little water in your rice, dunk your phone in a bowl of water first before throwing it in. The rice will pull out the excess moisture and will be perfect!
COOKING HACK: If you put too much phone in your water, toss a few rice in there. 
I feel like this is a bad call.
also make sure you only add an android device (running jellybean/marshmallow/nougat/etc) since they are the only ones that will actually add flavour. Throwing in an iPhone is pointless.  And for windows phones you might want to throw them in the trash
too many gorillas in your zoo? toss a kid in
If you accidentally get your iphone wet, you can use rice to dry it out.  Simply put the phone in a paper bag full of rice and leave it on the kitchen counter that overnight. The rice will attract asians who are smart have enough technological skills to know what to do about your damn phone.
Techrax just got a new idea for a vid
Where do I find the nutrition information for the phones?
Dumb?
I mean, why not? 
the math checks out on this one
The Muller Rice advert pops to mind: Rice! Rice! Baby! Now grab a spoon and listen!
Was the rice delicious?
Ahahaha this is amazing
I'd like to order one large phone with extra phones please.Cellphone, no no no rotary, with pay phone on half.
But why?
That is one gnarly hand
This has been reposted soooo many times 
The secret ingredient is phone.
If it's the iPhoneX you only need 6 of them
This is the funniest thing on the internet.
Why do these things ALWAYS have four fucking pictures?
I'm sorry I only accept IPhone Xs in my rice.
Oof
iPhone is especially effective at this!
Was the original picture someone accidentally cooking rice with phones in it? 
Ow
For extra crunch ad a Nokia 3310
That copy and paste tho..
Sometimes, kittens get in there.
My great uncle Phuc Dat Bich told me leaving your phone in a tub of rice overnight will fix your phone cause Asians will come and repair it overnight

I don't think he's going to drop out, I think he's going to flunk out.
I once watched a girl write on the first page of her notebook the first day of class ‚ÄúDROP THIS CLASS‚Äù Such confidence 
You won't believe #7!
been there.  that's how I essentially became a programmer.  Still stuck it and graduated with a psychology degree though.Now I work in a startup, wear whatever I want and show up whenever I want with beer on tap.Life is weird.  If you're reading this and wondering what you're going to do for the rest of your life.  Just know that although it might not seem like it, you have the power to do whatever the FUCK you want to do.  Wanna volunteer and help people all day?  Non profit employees make enough to do that and live happily in an apartment.  Wanna tour the world?  Get a job in whatever country you want to visit and just fucking GOOO.This isn't an excuse to just give up though.  Always just double check whether or not you're in the middle of a commitment you made to yourself.  Hey reader.  I love you.  Everything is going to be just alright. Hang in there.
Everyone always said "You'll miss college when you're finished."  I graduated over 6 years ago, and graduation day was one of the greatest and most freeing moments of my life. I still remember how much it sucked to do homework, do tests, and worry about being a failure. I still can't stand the thought of sitting in a lecture hall.I was utter trash at tests, couldn't memorize a thing from class, and always stressed myself out during big exams. I hate exams with a burning passion. Good riddance. I'm in a job I love (programming). I hated half of the college courses (and I still had to work at the same time to pay my tuition). College was total shite. My stress levels plummeted immediately after I graduated. I hope this guy makes it through. I'm proud that I graduated and don't have to listen to professors drone on about boring crap anymore. 
To be fair this was the type of shit I was stressing out about and looking at in my first year of uni and I've just graduated 4 years later with a masters so I have hope for this kid
Once had a class mate Google ways to embarrass your professor.
If he's going to use his phone to snap a pic of his screen, he should stay in college.
Now he needs another distraction from his distraction
Not going to lie perhaps I'll get downvoted for this, however I feel life dictate the whole "you need a degree to be someone" too much on a person life. Why should someone be force into that mentality. I seen people enter college without having their mind on what they want due to the amount of stress that was put upon them just to dropout later on. Life is a changing dependent variable. Today day of age is base on technology and whose not to say what tomorrow day of age will bring us. 
... Like we all haven't done that at some point
Saw a kid Google "What does it feel like to die?" in lecture.
He's got a surface book....
I was once sat behind a guy in a large lecture as a TA, tasked with ensuring students didn't surf the internet during class. Guy was buying a gun during an ethics lecture. I called him out for surfing the net. Only afterwards, when one of my fellow TAs said, "Dude, that was brave. I'd have kept my mouth shut", did I realize maybe calling out the guy with the gun might not have been the smartest idea. Hadn't even thought of it in the moment... 
Dude can get into construction and be a heavy duty crane operator making 120k a year, then spend 8 hours a day googling "top 10 best careers that only require 2 years of school".  Grass is always greener m8.
Hey, This isn't me! Ask me anything!
We've all google'd this once or twice in our lives.After college it shifts into ways to make money without working at all.Spoiler: I'm still working.
The girl next to him looks hot
aaand that's why I use my laptop in the back of class
We've all been there. Don't lose your soul.
I did drop out and become an industrial electrician. I am really happy with my choice. Although I do have an associates degree.
This just justified my irrational fear of classmates watching my computer screen if I don‚Äôt sit in the back row 
"Why did I go to college, mr. memory?""To make money, what else, mr. brain.""What if I can make money now and stop with this college?""Remember what I said: if you're unhappy with what you're learning, you're going to be unhappy with what you're doing.  So if you're going to be unhappy no matter what (you dislike school, for example) you might as well just do whatever makes the most money.""How much does this cost school cost again?"COMPLETELY REASONABLE DECISION TO LEAVE SCHOOLING WRITTEN ABOVE, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK
Asking as a college freshman, are you meant to be apathetic about it all?
My advice, learn about available certification you can get  that relates to your degree while working for your bachelors. Having just passed the Microsoft Technology Associate exam, I now have a lifetime certificate I can put on my resume regardless of whether I finish my degree or not.
I don't think I've ever laughed harder at a Reddit post.  ...I don't know what that says about me...
Omg this is one of my friends 
Ahh the ol *"what the fuck am I doing here"* jitters. Gud times ^ . ^
I was just like him
Elevator repair. Good luck getting into the profession but you will make a ton of money
People in front of me browsing internet in class is how I discovered reddit.
He's on Instagram also lol
Oil and Gas Operator really should be on that list.  Yeah it's a rough and dirty job where you spend a lot of time away from family, but those guys can make bank with the right company.  
If only you knew what I know. You'd stay in college forever.
Honestly I've done this too. Sometimes you think about how tough college is and how expensive it is; and doing this helped remind me why it's worth it 
Damn we're not ever half way through the semester.
Working full time in food service really was the best way for me to get determined to eventually get an education

It doesn't count as cosplay if you ARE Piccolo.
I'm incredibly impressed. Nice job!
YES, YES, YES, YES! I can win! I feel great! I! Can! Do! This! 
"I'm not a goddamn Yoshi!"
Amazing 
Way better than piccolo from dragon ball evolution. But we don't talk about that o_o
Damn it looks cool! Great cosplay :)
Really good cosplay
That's actually one of the best Piccolo cosplays I've yet to see(I've seen a little over 30 and you're at 2)
You from namek? 
This is really good. At first glance I thought it was a pic of a toy/figure
Awesome job. Are you wear prosthetic or is that your actual brow? Does the green face paint get everywhere, or does it dry?
Powerful Piccolo
Holt shit! Amazing dude!
I said this out loud just now: "This looks fucking amazing."
This is incredible. I‚Äôm so impressed. This is some of the best cosplay I‚Äôve ever seen.
Awh dude that's fucking awesome.
The look of disappointment when Gohan doesnt dodge
Nail'd it.
A..are you a yoshi?
Could see you yelling at other dbz cosplayers to "DODGE"       Next you should do piccolo in his driving outfit! 
Badass!! Spot on
Well fucking done. facial expression, costume, this is excellent! 
That cape detail though. Excellent work!
Thought I was looking at the Figuarts from the thumbnail.
This is the best piccolo costume ever. But your green face is horribly offensive. 
10/10 would make you a father figure
Don't normally comment but that is a fucking awesome cosplay, great job
r/dbz on r/all? hell yeah
AMAZING My dude
Yo awesome work man. Piccolo is my favorite dbz character and seeing any cosplay as amazing as this gets a 10/10. 
What's dragon con
How were doors? Did you have to use a 45 degree angle?
So dope
You gotta come to San Angelo, TX with that Cosplay next month, that are having a Con with several of the voice actors from aDB S and Missy Elliot with her super Iconic cosplay and you to can go at it.
Oh my god my childhood anime crush. This is amazing!
Amazing! The constantly annoyed face is spot on!
This is very impressive! 
Damn this is nice!! I've always wanted to wear the purple jumpsuit to look like gohan when he fought cell
That's one of the best I've seen of any DB character and Piccolo is one of the hardest to do. If you did the "I feel great!" pose, I bet it'd be a meme for years.
Whoa this is actually a fantastic piccolo cosplay
are the brows prosthetic, or are yours just glorious?
That is incredible. The best Piccolo I've ever seen!
Easily the best Piccolo cosplay I've seen.  Well done!
Maximum scowl

That is fucking fantastic, good job.

Never thought I'd see Kane cosplaying as Piccolo
I find his name funny because piccolo means small in Italian, but in the Italian Dragonball he was called Junior
Best dad in the series.

They backtracked because they're moving to Franchising, in which viewership matters more than competitiveness. End of story.
Bo3 works in Korea because they don't squeeze all their games into 2 days a week.  To run Bo3's you either need to run split streams (NA), cut down on the overall number of matches (EU) or play on more days each week (Korea, China, etc.).  Split streams mean you can't watch every game live and the less interesting matchup always has way fewer viewers, especially if there's a big match on the other.  Less popular teams get hosed and it's a vicious cycle of no fans --> no one watches games --> still no fans.Going to multiple days is risky and the teams that are buying in for $10mil+ want a safe return on their investment now.  Sure you could say "More Games = Better Teams = Better Worlds Performance = More Fans" but that's speculative at best and there's no guarantee any of those will actually happen.  Besides, being good at Bo1's is arguably the most important "skill" for advancing in international events because you don't even get to the Bo5's until you survive the Bo1 group (MSI play-in aside).  And even then, Bo5 success is 99% dodging Korean teams (shoutout to S4 OMG), and the actual best way of doing that is topping your group.And everyone agrees that the EU group format was the worst.edit: Since I wasn't super clear about it, I meant the shoutout to OMG beating Najin as the 1% who beat a Korean team in a Bo5 at Worlds after the Korean Hype Train went full blast in 2013.
What about Bo3 throughout the week? I remember one of them saying that there's too many games to watch especially with two streams at the same time which would be 4 teams playing up to six games total. What about spacing the games throughout the week? There we can all watch a one or two Bo3 a day instead of getting like up to 12 games in one day.
They mentioned on the Dive that one of the primary reasons is that people can't watch everything, if you wanted to watch all of the NALCS BO3s, EU, and KR you just physically couldn't have that much time. The problem with this argument is that I feel like very few people do want to watch everything. I only want to watch CLG/TSM/C9 games usually, so I am just straight losing multiple games from my favorite teams so I can.......not watch NV or EF still.
I love Bo3 too, but stop using anecdotal stories for your points. "Well, I always watch all the games blah blah blah..." Riot has the data. People aren't tuning in. That's pretty much the end of it.Could it be that Bo3's weren't actually the cause of viewership decline? I'd say that's fairly possible. I'd even argue the most likely reason for viewership decline is that this scene is 8 years old now and there are tons of new esports and other things vying for your attention than when it first started. But even if that's true the only thing you can do if you're Riot is switch back to Bo1s and hope to god it works. Or you can lay people off on the production side, and deliver a worse product.
In case you guys missed it, professional player feedback was that the Bo3 format [wasn't actually the primary reason the region improved](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/73ac9a/na_lcs_format_update_for_2018/dnouuns/). I can see that and I honestly think some of you guys, especially the OP, are putting way too much emphasis on a game format being the sole or most important reason that it seems NA is more competitive. The teams are much closer to their own improvement process than outside fans are, so everything the OP has said are reasons for Bo3 being better are immediately suspect as actually credible. And let's not overlook the facts - despite this being more competitive, it hasn't translated into Worlds success.I'm ok with the format going back to Bo1 from the perspective that I definitely was one of probably a lot of fans who watch more than a casual number of games but who just didn't have the time to invest watching Bo3s end to end, even not live. I watch a ton of competitive League but seeing the same 2 teams for 3 hours is a pretty big weekly time investment when you factor in that most fans are interested in watching multiple teams.Really my concern and criticism for Riot is that they're not enforcing the same format across regions. I get that because there's different entities running competitive play that this isn't always easy or maybe even possible to do, but to not have all your leagues play the same format just means competitively, players are playing the game differently because prep for the format differs. It's like saying the NBA's West teams should play a series Bo3 with their schedules while the East teams would play Bo1 with different teams on different nights for the most part as per normal. It's inconsistent in terms of how the game is supposed to be competitively played on a week-by-week basis, especially in the sense of determining standings and playoff seeding, and should be the same across the board if at all possible.
>It's more interesting to watch a 2 or 3 game seriesthe majority would disagree.riot even said it themselves. they looked at their metrics and they found out that viewers only watch 1 or 2 games of the bo3, tune in when they can, and most people don't even finish watching the whole series.https://youtu.be/oyqB4LK_MAY?t=2143
What if Spring Split was Bo1? Would allow for more cheese comps and a lighter schedule, but then Summer could be a Bo3 to help teams prepare for worlds with more stage time. Could be a good balance. The Bo3s could also be spread throughout the week, and even if you can't watch live you can watch the vods 
Bo3s make it more interesting and it's a good indicators of how good teams are "clean 2-0" "a close 2-1" we would lose that :(
I don't see why they don't try a similar LCK format.* 5 Days a week* Single stream (Yes SPOTV and OGN I get it, but NA LCS only has one broadcaster)* 2 games a day (6PM/9PM or 5PM/8PM ..etc)Just like watching NBA or NFL you don't have to watch every game. 
I love Bo3s but I don't see it being better than Bo1 for spectating in the regular season.The upside is that I'm not sure Bo3 stage experience is really that important for team practice. I don't think it'll hurt international performance unless the teams really focus on Bo1s only (which will screw them over in playoffs). The vast majority of the experience they get is from scrims. Hopefully they continue to do 3 and 5 game sets in scrims.
And a lot of us have the opinion that BO1's are a better format. Not to mention the viewers who aren't redditors. 
I prefer bo1 because then Ill keep watching longer(after 1 bo3 I most of the time don't feel up for another one)
I'm in the majority that welcomes the return of Bo1
With the Best of 3, I would only watch C9. With the Best of 1, I would watch games all day.
> We talked these trends through with pros via the NA LCS Players' Association and discussed the pros and cons of more games/competition vs. optimizing for more fans to tune in. When walking through various options, the majority of pros agreed that the benefits of Bo3 did not outweigh the tradeoffs. They also agreed that while a lot of regular season games could be effective, it has diminishing returns. In order to address the concern that Bo1s do not allow enough games for teams to develop proper synergy or preparation for international play, we're working with the Players Association and teams to make practice and scrims more efficient.I think this is an extremely important part behind Riot's decision making. If players themselves are finding that the increased stage time has diminishing returns then I can see how the Bo1 pros outweigh those of the Bo3s.I feel like a bigger reason as to why NA has gotten better is the improved infrastructure and more professional attitude towards the game. Since they mention working even more on improving scrim efficiency I'm willing to give Bo1's a chance.
I'll trust Riot to act in their own best interest over random posters that believe that they fully grasp the viewership situation without any of the data to back it up. 
I think riot is really goofing up on this one. If the bo3 format on friday, saturday, and sunday isnt working, maybe you spread it out more into the weekdays. Do what lck does their game day isnt only set on just 3days because they know viewership wont last 6hrs of watching league thats common sense. Even on football days no one spends 6hrs watching a regular season game. The right move on riot would be to spread out viewing days not keeping it condensed to 3days and they are doing on weekends when people tend to try to go out or hang out with friends.
Korea smiles as they see this, because they know that this only widens the gap.
Instead of 6 viewer hours out of me watching doublelift this spilt they will get 2 /: im going a third of my doublelift time and they lose a third od my viewship money 
I prefer Bo1s. It's more exciting, the pick and bans are more cut throat, there's more on the line, etc. The pressure, tension, and energy is what makes a good sport for me.
Sad to say it is set in stone.  This wouldn't have been announced if it wasn't.
This is not the end of the world and it is not the end of competitive NALCS.The changes in infrastructure are a much more significant reason that the overall level of play has increased. Practice has become more efficient, scrim culture has become more serious, and the huge infusion of money gives players larger incentives to improve. More viewers --> more money --> more incentive for players and more infrastructure --> more competitive region. This is why EU fans should be much more concerned about the lack of viewership. Players in 2015 blamed BO1's for their performance because it was an easy copout when they underperformed because they were terrible.Sure, an extra 20 games over a nine week period on stage may improve form a little bit, but the gap between NA and EU, China, and Korea in 2015 was so much larger than an extra 20 games on stage against the NA opponents at the time. Everything else stays. Fnatic and Origen reached the world's semifinals when the EULCS was best of 1. Finally, every international tournament uses best of 1 format in the group stage. NA might as well practice.As a viewer, BO1's increase the stakes of each individual game and therefore increases my enjoyment and desire to watch the games. Also, with 10 2-3 hour B03 a week, NALCS was putting out more content than a casual viewer could want to grasp or understand. This is just for the domestic league. Now include EULCS and possibly even LCK for the fanatics. There were just too many professional games being broadcast and supply was far outpacing demand. Lower tier teams were underexposed as viewers began to spend less time watching the streams. 
18 games a split is nothing short of a fucking joke. Honestly there's 82 games in a season of the NBA and each game is an average of 3 hours. You could literally play a whole split of LCS in the same time you can play 3-5 NBA games.
Here's some additional specific reasons Bo3 is incredibly important. 1) Subs are almost entirely worthless in a Bo1 system because there's no room to experiment. (the academy teams are pointless now...)2) Playing different styles and drafts is seriously hampered in Bo1 because it's always do or die, thereby giving teams way less room to improve. If you liked the fact that TSM worked for the longterm on their Gallio, you can say goodbye to anything like that ever happening again because in Bo1 they never would have had the legroom to even try that. 3) People will actually watch even less of the teams they aren't interested in since say for example if you're a TSM fan you now only play one game against Echo Fox rather than a 2-3 game series. 4) Bo1 heavily skews the standings where worse teams can actually finish higher, and since top two positions in the league get a bye to the semifinals, this has serious ramifications on team income. Better placing teams are supposed to receive significant financial rewards in the franchise system. In a world where higher placement gets large fiscal rewards, competitive integrity matters more than ever, something that Bo1 does not foster well.
Honestly though it's super fucking hard for me to care about the less competitive teams with the current format, though that's also partially because of my bad work schedule. It's already hard enough for me to go through all the LCK games because of how long the series can take. They either need to adopt the LCK-like schedule by spreading the games across the week or go ahead with the changes.In addition I used to be more in opposition to Bo1 but then I realised and remembered the OSL and Proleague in Brood War featured quite a few Bo1 matches than Bo3/Bo5. Though they're very different games and adopting a Proleague format is impossible. In addition Bo1 means match preparation matters more than adaptability in the context of League, so it's not nearly as bad as I think it would be.I wonder if it's possible to incorporate a knock out tournament that features Bo3/Bo5 though that's entirely separate from the League.
This makes me happy. I watched way more LCS when it was bo1. Bo3s were long, boring, and the better team was going to win 99% of the time anyway. I understand the competitive aspect but as a player who has been addicted to league for 5 years now, I have basically stopped watching league. I'll probably watch it like I used to now that I can get to see every team play in a single day in a quick fashion. 
You can also add, what it the point of subs if you cant change them to adapt mid series? NALCS is getting farm teams finally due to franchising, and then they remove the use for subs? Sure, we can use them for playoffs and worlds, but without any actual experience utilizing our subs it would probably hurt us more then help us trying to use subs....
I would much rather spend my time watching series. I see their arguments as valid, but for myself (who watches at least 3-5 different teams across different regions) I just won't watch when my NA teams aren't on. Before I enjoyed watching the series because it influenced playoffs and to see who beat who better or in fewer games I enjoyed that. I enjoyed watching lesser teams try for wins and get two chances a week. And honestly go back and take a look at the standings from last year if we were in a best of one format. Tsm would have barely made playoffs. The lost the first game in what 2/3 of their series? Idk it seems like a back track and we'll go back to seeing bottom feeder teams every year who show no improvement, or we'll have arguably weaker teams make it to playoffs while stronger teams don't get a chance to show it.
I'm kinda happy about the change.  I used to watch NA and EU all the time.  Then the format changed and I stopped watching EU.  Then I stopped watching all of NA because I couldn't watch it all live which was an aspect I for some reason liked.  Eventually I just stopped watching it altogether waiting for playoffs or MSI or whatever.  I don't know if I'm going to watch everything again in Spring but I'll give it a shot for sure.
I know I'm the minority at least on reddit but I prefer Bo1 over Bof3. I find that I watch more games cause there is more randomness which I enjoy. If a top team is playing a weak team for a Bof3 I am likely to watch none of the games while I might watch a Bo1 in case the other team is able to pull out the win. However, I'm definitely a casual league watcher for regular season so it might be better for Riot to please the more hardcore watchers for the season and go to Bo3. I'll still watch playoffs regardless. Just my 2 cents
Personally I don't agree. Best of 1s were always easier to schedule into a busy week. I would only have to catch a few games. With best of 3s, I have to block out an entire two hours (sometimes) just to watch a series with a team I like. If two teams I like are playing at the same time, I have to choose which one to watch. These factors have made me watch LCS less this year than any other year.
I'm supporting BO1 for the reasons you mentioned.Out of all the things people argue about in League, this is probably one of those that makes a lot of sense from both perspectives.
It sounded like they did get feedback from viewers and teams already. I don't think they would take this decision lightly. I have to ageee on a fair amount of their points. And to the point of it being competitive NA struggles getting out of groups. Maybe bo1s is better for NA right now. Practice their round robin. I would be down with an additional game or two being played on Friday. At international events teams will need to be prepared for three teams not just two. Let's add that to the regular season. Some weeks teams will only play 2 games and other weeks 3. More games = more viewership while not interfering with watching other games. 
I dunno man, I really hated split streams. Mostly because they'd immediately spoil whichever stream finished first on the other stream.
There's such groupthink that reddit is the ONLY source of LCS viewers - in reality, it's not. Most people on reddit take the game fairly seriously to some degree, whereas it's more likely that non-redditors are more casual viewers/players. As someone who is only a casual player these days, Bo1 is far better for me - I don't really have time to invest loads of time into a Bo3 these days. It's obviously worse for the teams, but I'd rather watch shit teams to completion than not watch a whole series with better teams. It's a selfish decision but it makes tons of sense, and if viewership is down Riot will obviously correct it.Not to be to anecdotal, but since NA LCS switched to Bo3, over half of my friends have stopped watching. When you've got uni/work/socialising, it's just not as appealing to watch Bo3s every week. 
Summer i only watched IMT and CLG bo3 did not watch a single regular season game other then these 2 teams at least it was easy to leave stream on in between bo1 now it's like aight i got at least 3 hours till the "good series" starts okay gonna go get some beers or go outside not gonna watch 3 hours this clown fiesta.bo1 Most likely boosts viewer amount and if that is the only thing riot wants then this is a good move.bo1 at least to me will make it more fun to watch and i was already thinking to just watch LCK anyway so with this chance i am 100% going to watch NA LCS spring. 
I can understand the desicion, since they moved away from BO1 I never watched a full day of LCS, let alone matches of weaker teams. In the earlier days I sat down and watched every single game so, yeah I am happy with this change.
When EU and NA were playing BO1s I used to watch every single EU/NA game + every match in Korea + the occasional LPL match. Now that EU/NA are playing BO3s i basically stopped caring about most teams in both regions because I'm not able to watch their matches, which in turn leads to me caring less about my favorite teams playing because I don't care who they're playing against anymore. I also watch less LCK and no LPL at all.Obviously this is only from my perspective but I guess there are a lot more viewers like me.
My vote is to make spring Bo1 and summer Bo3. Let spring be more of a story telling split with super weeks and all. Then when summer comes, we ramp up into Bo3 in preparation for worlds.
i personally dont like the points system in league. I feel like teams should get more points for a 2-0 then a 2-1. Also the team with the 1-2 should get something in return. you could say something like 2-0 = 3 points for the victor/ 0 for the loser. and a 2-1 is 2 points for the victor, 1 point for the loser. That would make each game feel more important.
bo1 is better imo or bo2, bo3 just too many filler games
On the good side, maybe the eSports scene will open up to more competition and we'll find a better eSport?...because this decision by Riot pretty much seals the deal that I won't want to watch in 2018. BO3 was the biggest positive change I've seen them do... it made the whole season feel like it was actually preparing teams for Worlds.
As a viewer, I'm glad for Bo1. I wasn't interested in watching League for 6 hours just to see two of my favorite teams play. However, I think the level of play of NA will drop drastically and it'll hurt their chances of ever being competitive internationally severely. 
Put the stream in the client like Valve has Dota international on steam and spread out the games over the week instead of having it on the weeekend.
Personally I feel BO2 is the fairest system due to Side selection, for no unfair advantage, With that however there can be Win Tie and Defeats (China and EU have had this system in the past) and personally it is the most fair system you can use, BO1 and BO3 could just be determined by which side is strongest with X picks on Y patch.As a Viewer who likes watching the rivals play as well BO2>BO1>BO3 
please for the love of god keep Bo3s. If it weren't for Bo3s i probably would have stopped following NA LCS. IDK what Riot is thinking
bo1 is more interesting 
LOL Those are some underhanded points for Bo1's! I enjoy Bo1 much more! Watching the play in's was great. Seeing insane picks coming out and "Safe" Picks being punished!
Better for spectators, I understand, but you're slaughtering the long term. In 5 years when NA has sucked every single year at worlds, how many fans will be left? How's your viewership then. BO1 is a terrible move when there are plenty of other options on the table to manage viewership. 
Why not implement a draft system for players so that shitty teams get a chance? 
money> competition
I feel like people forget that these teams will still scrim each other all the time? I don't think NA will lose as much as a competitive edge as people are whining about. Also remember that this is reddit. We are all crazy about the game while there are way more silent casual fans out there. Sure Bo3 TSM/C9 can be hype but where was everyone during the six hour NV/Echo TL/FLY ? and the Duo streams? It's horrible for viewership. I too will miss best of 3's but I don't think it will make NA much worse  and it will definitely make games more exciting!edit: I'm just pointing out I do not like the change to bo1. Although, I personally don't think more on stage games = better teams. Better practicing, scrims, teambuilding, coaching, etc create better teams. Investors/Teams kinda forced riots hand for more numbers :/
I never watched any LCS this season cause i dont have time. I can watch one game a day if im lucky.
I for one welcome bo1's backI really hope riot doesn't fall back on this because of reddit vocal minority complaints  
Ads is a big factor for franchise too. If there are 2 bo3s on friday that no one is gonna watch, sponsors wont want to play their ads on that day, and there wont be enough airtime to play all the sponsors' ads on the day when viewers are actually tuning in, so they might be discouraged from sponsoring at all
I don't agree with this but I'm willing to trust Riot with this 
Im gonna spend the time watching LCK rebroadcast rather than watching NALCS live that's bo1 with shitload amount of ad/sponsorship mention.Franchising is good boi! 
It's our fault they're switching. Us the hardcore fan. They know we're watching regardless. But the casual fan wants bo1. So if they switch to bo1 they pick up viewership and don't lose us.
I will admit that while I like Bo3 more, it felt easier to watch the old format. Every weekend at the same time and I could easily open the stream and see who's playing now and when my favorite teams will be playing. I never got used to the new times of Bo3 streams. 
As a person who watches 4 regions (NA, LPL, LMS, LCK), I love this change. This lets me have more time to catch up with the other regions that's not NA while at the same time allow me to do other stuff I need to do in life. Although I'm kinda sad that it won't be as competitive, at least I won't have to worry about not having enough time to watch all the games in NA.
I'm 100% ok with it being a BO1, I want to watch all the teams play, not 1-2 teams play 3 times. The games become incredibly boring to watch when they're gonna be stomps twice in a row, and streaming 2 games at once is a terrible idea. 
I was never going to watch a bo3 between p1 and NV, but if you tell me tl is playing next and it's a best of 1 I'll probably sit through the game like I used to when ggu and xdg used to play in their separate seasons. 
Bo3 so far hasnt changed NA success in international competitions. The whole point of this was to increase competition which it hasnt done really. 
BO1 is a better viewing experience and I am all for it. ESPECIALLY when BO1's are still such an important part of all international events. 
Or maybe a lot of you have a very stupid opinion.* If a bo3 format were more interesting to watch viewership wouldn't have declined during its implementation. It is more decisive in deciding the superior team, but that's not an inherently positive thing. As it prevents the aspect of Any Given Sunday or Do You Believe In Miracles. * Your second and third bulletpoint are contradictory. * Yes, so fix the other regions as well. The format only matters from a competitive aspect when it grants an adv/disadv.* Because it has failed.
I never understood the argument that people only watched 1 or 2 games. Like maybe I am a more hardcore fan of a few teams than others, but I would check the schedule and see when my favorite teams played. I would then ONLY tune in to watch them play, I might miss game 1 due to the time shifts but I would only watch them. Now with this shitty Bo1 format again, there is a chance you might miss the whole game if they move quicker. I just don't like the competitiveness of Bo1's. Why can NA not learn from our Korean overlords? They are on a Bo3 system, and their viewer base is huge! The points for Bo1 are stupid af too. Like seriously shorter commitment, like why is that even a factor? You will miss a game. If you don't want to set through the whole series why not watch the deciding game?  Which is the second point. And more views is not guaranteed. I honestly might not even be able to catch the games, Ill just watch vods or just the quick notes. The problem with the Bo3 system is they had 2 streams. Thats splitting the viewership. (with riot logic anyway). there was times where 2 teams I followed played at the same time on both streams. I could only support 1 of them. 
I think bo3 but spreading the games out over the week a bit more would be the best solution.
If they could always convert Spring season to , "Pre-season" and reduce the impact on world's qualifications.Shorter spring. Spread out summer Bo1's and do a double round robin finals or losers bracket for groups.This would spread out the games and reduce watcher fatigue.
I think the main reason riot wanted bo1 was that they don't want TSM  winning the split. (TSM won every single split since bo3 started)
Don't worry, it's coming back. I mean, I'm guessing.Here's the thing, switching to Bo1s is generally economically bad for the league. Yes, average viewership per game goes up, but overall viewer-time goes down and if you're planning on running ads, that's a loss and *eventually* ads/product placement/logos on jerseys ought to be the financial basis of the LCS. Granted, it's not really a loss in the value of your product long term because you could always return to Bo3s, but in the short term you're taking a loss.So why do it?Well, they're trying to get teams to buy into the franchising model which involves giving riot a shitload of money up front. And in order to get the most out of that, they have to raise the value for all the teams, because they presumably have to charge them all the same. TSM doesn't have to pay more to buy into the franchise system than Echo Fox. So Riot needs to raise the value of what Echo Fox is buying, not TSM. And when we have Bo3s, the league gets more ad revenue (if they properly run ads) but it's going to be concentrated in the big teams' games, so your Echo Foxes aren't going to want to spend as much to get into the league and even though TSM would get *more* value buying into the league, Riot won't see any of that. So we get Bo1s.But once the teams have bought into the system, it's immediately in the interest of Riot - and all of the larger fanbase teams - to switch back to Bo3, since that's good for the league overall. The incentive to switch to Bo1 is 100% in that initial buy-in. Granted, the contracts will probably limit them to some degree, but Riot knows and will defend their future interests.And, they even announced this change with messaging that said basically "but we might change back, we're watching closely." Right.
I had a strange idea of using a format with a Bo3 for one match of the round robin and Bo1 for the other. It probably wouldn't work because of how confusing the schedule would be, but basically they could do one day has 2 Bo3 series and another day has the 5 games.
bo1 would work if they adopt a longer season with fewer meta shifts and play more frequently, but i doubt those things happen. bo5 is pretty awful outside of watching the top teams...especially late in the split when half the teams literally have nothing to play fora huge concern for them should be to create interest in development league viewership... which might mean incorporating it into the lcs broadcast somehow
I feel that if we were to keep the Bo3 format, and with the idea of playing throughout the week, maybe if there was some sort of idea that was more akin to traditional sports, especially if we could play more games through the year. 
I dont even feel like seeing my own team in BO1 ill just watch the highlights after on youtube 
Double cycle BO1 + BO3BO1 Can't let us see the bench
Bo1 is way more friendly for casual viewers, and the truth is most viewers are casual.  Chances are the people who go on reddit and voice their opinions on Bo3 are far from casual.
Come on, you can't just say "it's more interesting to watch a 2 or 3 game series"
As someone who watches every single LCK match, but only watches NA LCS for TSM, bo1 kind of sucks since I'll only get to watch 18 games of my favourite team per split, instead of 36-54 in the bo3 format 
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/178479874 Travis talked about this topic on his show with MarkZ and was really informative about the issue, had guests call in through discord to voice their opinions on the matter. segment with Mark starts at the one our mark. 
I am Japanese, so sorry about the bad english While i do agree Bo3 is better for competitive stands point, change of Bo1 might be better overall due to franchise system for 2018.‚óèless time to watch low quality level of game--> Bo3 gain benefit by watching top tier teams (e.g. c9 vs TSM)many people are pointing out that the level of game might drop for next year because many teams might start use new players who are inexperience since teams dont need to worry about being  regulation. Teams can start build healthy ecosystem for long run rather than short run.Best example that might occur for this case is Phoenix 1, Echo Fox, CLG and Team liquid. I am assuming other teams might use sub as the experiment.Franchise system is brand new eco system for Esport.This is like whole new experiment for everybody.  Including Viewers, Riot and Team.... they dont know what to except for next year.If the level the game drop and Bo3, it will be horrible experience for viewers. If it is Bo1, those risk can be minimize. As evidence, riot presents drop of viewsship for low tier game for this year. What will happen next year? As 1 st year of franchise system, team and riot need the time build healthy eco system.Maybe this is one of the reason why riot chose to go Bo1 system.What do you guys think?P.S. I think changing regular split is more important...8 month is too long. one of the reason why they change to Bo1
We want league to be profitable so it can grow, which leads to more support and the potential for better talent. Bo1s increase viewership 
maybe it only happens in the next season
As much as I think I like Bo3, I honestly found myself more interested in and enjoyed the Bo1 format more. 
Back in old BO1 format I watched all games. Even the bad teams cause 1-2 fiesta games are pretty funny. The last split specifically I haven't watched a single echofox/tl/p1 game unless they were facing tsm/c9 and only because I wanted to see tsm/c9. Now with the upcoming bo1 format I'm more likely to watch these games since I'll only have to invest maybe half the time watching them.
I mean if we want to get out of groups, we gotta get good at cheesing. 
First we needed BO3, then more international competition, now we need BO3 again...so many excuses for not being good and our best showing at Worlds was when we still had BO1s. There's more that goes into results than just BO3 obviously. Perhaps people not taking scrims seriously and going ham all the time for kills instead of practicing new specific things they wanna learn for Worlds would be better use of them, instead of only playing that way on stage. 
Someone mentioned it in another thread, but I'd love it if the actual answer Riot came up with was Bo3, one game a night but games going all week.They have enough casters they should be able to do this without having anyone have to work 7 days straight. The one game a night gives a regular thing "Oh, it's 8pm? time to watch league!". The fact that you don't have a lot of games on in a row mean people are consuming in smaller chunks for less fatigue. You also get more viewers since "if you want to watch league tonight, you watch what is on."TSM and C9 will still be the big draw nights (and CLG and IMT) but just having it on more regularly leads to more casual watching.This is also what other spots that play with a series instead of Bo1 (read: American Football) do. They space their games out across the whole week so that there is generally always a game going on around prime time for folks to watch.Heck, combine the two. TSM plays 6 matches a week. THey play 1 game a day for 4 days, and 2 games on one day for a double header. The team can still scrim and do other stuff. They get a "real match" every day of the week more or less. the fans get more games. and there's a pull like TSM/C9/CLG spaced out niceless across the week to keep viewers interested enough to watch the less popular teams as well
Maybe it's just me but am I the only one in thinking that the (No offense) shit teams were the majority in making this decision on the player/team side because they knew they couldn't compete against TSM, IMT and Cloud 9 in best of 3's?  They certainly lost a viewer in me and I'll just watch a VOD later in the day where I dont have to watch a bunch of crappy games before I get to the one I want to watch
I personally would love 1 Bo3 in the afternoon (maybe like 5-7 start time PST, 8-10 EST) on Monday-Thursday and then 2 Bo3 Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Obviously what I would like doesn't mean shit, but that would be my perfect schedule. 
No. Bo1 and more side content!
I'd much rather have the games on during the weekdays too because weekends are for more than just watching LCS. People can't commit their whole Saturday and Sunday afternoons to LCS all the time, and I think that's the main issue.
Add to the list of points for Bo1s that the dual streams they run for Bo3s is also painfully inconvenient to everyone involved (casual, commentators, coaches, analysts, etc.)
Bo2 master race.Best format. 
I watch pretty casually for the entire season up until worlds, if you ask me the more games during the regular season the better never have I looked at the nalcs and thought "oh it's a best of 3 I won't have the time for this" typically i just watch 1 game of my favorite team maybe 2 if I got the time 
Please no! I really enjoyed the series format so much more
Now you guys know how it feels
I stopped watching because of BO3, I can't wait for the switch back!
I created a thread for this already and would like to keep the poll going http://www.strawpoll.me/14039310/r
Why isn't NA like a nightly BO3 like Korea? I'd love to be able to just throw on a pro game after dinner every night. 
I agree with all the reasons they listed for moving away from Bo3s in the coming split, and I'd like to throw in a couple more. Bo3s were always a poor way to do the regular split. Riot doesn't use Bo3s anywhere else in the scene. Playoffs, relegations, and tournaments are all decided by full Bo5 sets and Bo1 round robin group stages. Bo3s have actually been detrimental to both TSM and G2 internationally as both teams have continually struggled in Bo1 group stages.NA doesn't need Bo3s, but they do need more than just 18 game seasons. As much as Bo3s is not really adequate prep for Riot tournament group stages, 18 games and only 2 matches a week is even worse. Most tournaments use expedited systems that require teams to play multiple games vs multiple teams over a weekend. 2 games a week is just not enough.I think they should have used double round robin Bo2s (or call it double headers - it doesn't need to be a "series") or go back to quad round robin. The teams don't like the latter because they don't want to prep for 4 teams per week, and the fans meme'd EU off the face of the earth about Bo2s and ties so now we all suffer.
Ya'll have to remember CLG made MSI finals when NA had BO1 in Spring 2016. 
Why not both? Friday - Saturday Bo1 8 teamsSunday Bo3 remaining 2 teams who didn't play Fri/Sat
I'll watch LCS no matter the format 
Wouldn't it switch back to series matches in the playoffs? 
For a casual viewer like me, I'd prefer BO1, just because its 1 match to watch that decides the winner, as i was never interested enough to watch 3 for same teams. Additionally, that will take less time to watch the entire thing, making it more accessible without missing out on any match. 
I think BO1 has the opportunity to be something beneficial. Yes, BO3 is more indicative of who is the "better team", but hopefully with franchising there are a lot more competitive teams. Not everyone has to be TSM fans or C9 fans or CLG fans. If franchising can help "close the gap" so to speak between the top teams and the bottom teams, BO1 will be more entertaining because I'll actually want to watch every game and more importantly, I'll be able to watch every game.
>- It's more interesting to watch a 2 or 3 game seriesNot if you're sitting through Ekko Fox vs Team Liquid
I like Bo3s as a viewer. It's nice to tune in on a Saturday and (if I'm lucky) both matches go to 3 games so I'm pretty much watching league all day. That's awesome. But I remember one time on Greatest League Talkshow, Mark and Scarra were saying how its hard for them as analysts because games are going on (NALCS1) while other games are going on (NALCS2) so it's hard to study two games at once and they sometimes miss some key things and they would rather the Bo1s. So I can see how changing it to Bo1s would help in this regard.
I need a /u/papayadreaming post talking about how the reddit hivemind went from loving franchising to turning on it because of Riot's shitty decision to switch to Bo1
I think LCS (both NA and EU) need a BO2 with a **score system**.**3 point for the winning team who pulls off a 2-0, 1 point for each team if they go 1-1, 0 point for the team who loses both matches**.It's way better for both viewers and teams to have potential for revenge and comebacks. It has the advantages of BO3 ("storylines unfolding", more strategy in drafts ) with higher stakes (because you can not drop a single game - much like in BO1 - to maximize your score) and without the disadvantages of BO3 for viewers (too many games). There's a reason why this format has been popular in football (soccer) for decades and decades.I get it that people are more likely to watch an "uninteresting" game between two bottom tier teams if it's BO1, and that BO2 presents the same problematic of viewership dropping for those matches, but I think the tradeoff is worth it.To minimize the problem, you could spread the two games over the "competitive weekend": have each team play one game on saturday, then they play the same team on sunday. You don't clog the stream with two "minor" games back to back, teams have time to refine their strategy over the next day, and score gets assigned at the end of the competitive week. It could also help fidelize viewers over the course of the weekend, make them come back to see if yesterday's match end up in a stomp or if there's an upset.BO1 means teams will perfect a single type of strategy and we will see the same comps over and over and LCS teams will get wrecked once international competition starts.
Bo2 would be the perfect compromise imo.
its hard to argue/debate their reason to change back to BO1... its a franchise model league... its a business after all.    * investors that have invested millions into the league/teams/riot and riot/teams themselves risking and investing so much want and need to make a profit to make this a long lasting esports league.    * in the end making money is what matters and if BO1 increases the viewership count that means its the best way to go (after all they (Riot) did state that they have statistics that their viewership count was much greater when the format was BO1 rather than BO3.    * i personally dont like BO1 format (i much prefer BO3 format) but im not in a situation or a person thats invested so much of my money into this league/game/industry.
>It is more interesting to watch Bo3 gamesFor you maybe, I find them too long.
They did an episode of "The Dive" on YouTube on this subject...
A Bo2 format is what should be used
My biggest question is do we have a stat for how many teams won the first game but lost the series? AKA wins teams got from it being a Bo3 as opposed to a Bo1.
The data that they have based on their surveys, focus groups, etc and their viewership numbers says more fans like a BO1 format and that is more entertaining for them. Competitive wise though, I agree BO3 makes the region better. 
i really liked bo3s, showed how teams adapt. this will hurt NA teams progression i think. and i will feel less valuable winning or losing 1 game. It would be like who's got cheese to win, but i suppose lately trend has been that teams who adapt in game win more regardless of early game cheese. but i really like watching my team play more games :/ 
Hmmm why not both, I mean wouldn't it be possible to have two games of BO1 with each teams and then one BO3 or BO5 in the middle of the split?
People will want to watch top teams playing bo3 occasionally, but at the same time, no one want to watch some bottom-tier team playing bo3 against each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ussCHoQttyQ
With bo3s i can see with my limited time, you know some of us needs to work. About competitivness we should wait and see how na teams  perform at worlds after 2 years bo3s.
I can only imagine how much Riot is praying for NA to do bad at Worlds this year so they can say "BO1's doesn't make them any better".
Bo3 are "better" cause it's in the favourite teams favor, it decreases the chances of upsets. As a TL fan i want Bo1 :')
rito doesn't give a flying shit. if they think this sells more skins, fuck you. fuck competition. MONEY $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
I guess I'll just go back to only watching Korea. I don't feel like anything is gleaned in Bo1 and I'd rather familiarize myself with the teams that will be relevant internationally.
I like the bo3 format simply because I pick and choose which teams I watch, however I wouldn't mind even a bo2 format like EU LCS. It means you aren't fucked over for losing one game and it is overall a better indicator of skill than bo1 while maintaining a time period that isn't "too long" to watch as a casual viewer. I dislike waiting two hours for the first bo3 to finish for the one I want to watch to come on if it goes to a game three, and this would help with that. I just don't find bo1 interesting at all, which is a problem. 
Even without watching every game, I always made out time to watch the highlights of every game. We complained about the BO1 system for a reason. In the end I guess Riot would do what they feel is best for them. BO3 is definitely more entertaining in my opinion and as obvious as this may seem, a step backwards isn't the way forward
>Casual playersWhat does it have to do with being a casual player or not?I think you meant casual viewers.
follow D2's tournament format
Still dont get the argument that it will increase the viewership drastically. Now we will get at least 2.5 times less stuff to broadcast. Even if we assume that a person could watch only 6 series with the dual stream compared to 10 series then they would still need 50% increment in viewership to get the same cumulative time watched. Also the viewership dropped because they changed the channels so their target audience of casual monkeys didnt get the memo and started watching other stuff. 
Despite agreeing Bo1s are easier to watch as a viewer, I'd take the hit if it gave pro players more games they felt they needed to be competitive. However, if the pros come out and say Bo1s are easier on them or something then fine, win win I suppose. I get that they are franchising, and viewership equals money which more of could possibly be used to support teams but 
Don't take me wrong, but Rito fucked that up. I have no other optiin than stop watching league. EULCS is extremely boring. I wachted like 10 gamesfrom both splits and now NALCS will switch to BO1 which make it unwatchable because every aspect of high competition will be missing. Best of 1 is like playing professional football match based only on result of one penalty kick. Which is ridiculous... After that even competition between west end east will wide the gap as it was 2 3 years ago. And for me, as a fan who always cheered for western team when it came to match against eastern team, it will be pointless to watch team, that is not skilled as opponent. But Riot doesn't give a shit about quality of competition, money money money money. 
Bo1 is better since i will be able to watch more teams.
"Casual viewer" here. Bo3 was pretty bad, and I agree with riot on their choice to revert to bo1 for a few reasons:1) bo3 was really only good for very few matchups between top teams. Bo3 between bottom teams are unwatchable, and bo3 between top and bottom team, I would just tune in for game 3.2) way too many games to watch to follow one region. Dont even get me started on TWO regions. Back when we had bo1 I would watch a good deal of games both from eu and na. Now I just watch very few na.3) bo1 makes games between top and bottom teams more interesting because upsets.4) bo1 makes cheese picks more viable because they cannot just be banned next game.5) bo1 makes me watch even games between teams that I don't really care about, because it's just a small time investment and I'm not already fed up from a long bo3 series. This has the upside that those teams now have at least a chance to gain one fan.6) bo3 incentivized following only 1 or 2 teams. This meant that I would know nothing about all the other teams and in turn makes it less interesting to follow the scene as a whole. Basically with the same time investment I can follow 6 teams instead of 1 or 2, which means I'm more knowlegeable on the league overall and this makes it more interesting going further into the season. Similarly knowing about both na and eu teams makes international turnaments more interesting.
THIS IS NOT OK. Im so fucking sad words cannot describe. BO1s SUCK
Solid way to make sure NA doesnt compete at worlds. 
all im gonna say is:  the format has nothing to do with why i dont watch lcs.  its just too much, too many games. i've been playing league since s1 and watching since IEM hannover 2011. the fact that lcs has no real elimination character until the playoffs just makes the whole process so boring. 
I love how they say people don't watch all of the dual stream Bo3 and so we are moving to Bo1. Its your fault for scheduling them like that and putting them at the same time. I've hated that part since they announced it. Doing a late night match on weekdays and an earlier morning match on weekends instead of overlapping your games would definitely increase overall viewer numbers.
Another advantage of BO1 is that it's easier for Riot to keep to schedule, and not have games be postponed by 2 hours or even pushed forward by 1.That being said I much prefer BO1, since I will only watch 1-2 Teams anyway and I prefer having more games of those teams to watch, which I believe was one of the reasons Riot pointed out before moving to BO3 in the first place.
We should make all tournament into BO1 format for the sake of viewership. Casual viewers don't have time for BO5 in World Finals./s
I've been fan of the NA LCS since ever (even when I'm from EU) and I am really proud of this year's results so far. Going back to Bo1, more casuall-ish style will leave us in a weird spot once again. Bo3 drafts and strategies are closer to Worlds (or just international competition) and I think that's the best experience we can get.Cannot put into words all my thoughts as everything has been said but... I think this is a mistake
> It's more interesting to watch a 2 or 3 game series#> We initially moved from a Bo1 to a Bo3 system, why backtrack?Maybe next time try reading the article Riot published before posting? I just skimmed through it and still saw their reasoning behind the change. Part of which was: no, it's not more interesting because over 50% of viewers never watch the whole series.
Reminder that reddit isnt the only internet community
Watching cheese strats is the most fun things during regular season and BO1 allows for upsets. It's worse at measuring competiveness, but good teams are still more likely to win, and have their best of-series for playoffs, so I am fine with that.
With eulcs switch to the chamions league format and nalcs switching to bo3 it is a sad year for competative value in league. Let's hope the entertainment value riot is going for is worth it
I think this move was obvious. The number of viewers for both NALCS and EULCS are much lower. I remember regular season games getting 200,000 - 300,000 viewers during the old B01 days. Now, you see one stream with ~100,000 and the other with 10,000-20,000.Bitch all you want, but they had to do something. They want this sport to grow. 
I was super casual this summer split. I think I had it on in the background for tsm and watch the shit show that is dardoch. 
i prefer bo1.
Maybe what needs to be considered for NA LCS is more like a baseball series? Multiple games a week are played against the same team. It could still be Bo3, but with more time in between, and more games for everyone. Example: schedule 3 games of C9 and TSM, one on each of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. You still get a Bo3, but even if a team goes 2-0, there is still a third game for league points, fantasy points, fan support, competitive play time, strategic testing, and *shudder* advertising.  Perhaps there could be games in the season against other leagues (eu lcs). If Bo3 are still requested by teams and fans, perhaps there could be 1 weekend a month, or a season. A "Madness" weekend of all Bo3. 
No, best of 1 is better since I don't have to sit through 2 or even 3 games of the same team whom I don't like.
Moving to Bo1 would be an incredible step backwards. Yes, it might help financially in the short term, but I don't think viewership numbers will stay good if the league goes down the drain.Bo1 would just mean instead of 4-6 games I'll just watch 2 games per round. It'd also take away valuable development time for teams trying to reach the level of the top teams.Don't be fooled Riot, making it Bo1 won't make me watch EF, TL or other orgs. It won't make me tune in to other games I don't care about.All you will  do with this change is lower the quality of the league. Just look at EULCS if you want to see what a bad format can do to a league. Used to be such a great league, now no one gives a fuck about EU thanks to weird format and ties.
Professional LoL is not like Basketball, Football or any other sports in the world. Being on the blue side or red side has it's advantages (mostly on pick and bans). You cannot just make it best of one and call it fair competition. Really disappointing from Riot. 
Or .... BO3 ... games throughout the week like real sports?
If they keep changing the format every year I'm going to stop watching it at all. It's no wonder EU and NA have a hard time every year past the Spring and Summer splits, there's virtually no consistency at all. What's the point of all this "viewership" if none of the sponsors get time to show their brands anyway?
Calling it now Na is going to be a giant disappointment at world's in 2018 the gap is going to get wider. This is going to be wonderful. 
dude your title is so bad, it seems you are shitposting at first glance, had to read your post to realize you meant "na lcs needs TO KEEP the bo3 format"
Bo3 so much better than Bo1.
They need Bo1s or they'll never get out of groups without the practice for the worlds group format lul
Personally i think a hybrid option would be awesome for example double round robin with BO1 for most games but 1 game per week in a 10 week season with but every week there would be one best of 3. In ten weeks this means every team plays 2 BO3 this doesnt have to be what they go with but its a kool idea
If you do Bo3 you need to space the games/matches out more during the week. Personally I know I'd watch a lot less if that were the case as I only really watch league at the weekend when I have time. Bo1 suits me fine and it doesn't change the competitiveness much either, there's not many ways to "cheese" the enemy team or steal wins in this game, so it's more that Bo1 just puts added pressure on teams considered favorites. Either way if they've researched this as much as they say and they've talked to the players than I don't see why this needs to be a big deal. They'll always be able to keep international/large tournaments as bo3/bo5.
> The result of 1 game is not indicative of who is the better teamregular season is not there to show you "who is CLEARLY the better team at this fucking moment".People and their NEED for a clear winner. If people could chose they'd even put them in bo5 or bo7 regular season just to have it their way.I agree bo1 is not the best, however we have the best and you'll never take it. Bo2 is far better. But then people are like "but we don't like ties because we MUST know who is a little bit better at this current time in this meaningless game". The fact is: no, you don't NEED to know that. It's a regular season game, it's pretty meaningless. What matters is who is the strongest during playoffs.At the end of the day it's all about money. If players and teams get way more money of course they'll chose this option. Bo3 or not you are not getting an NA worlds winner unless they improve a shit ton and improving happens behind the scenes and with the extra staff you get. The best the west has ever been and arguably the best team to play and represent the west was s5 Fnatic. They played in bo1 and still were super strong while other regions had bo2 and bo3. Shocking right? Don't act like you are not going to win worlds BECAUSE you don't have bo3. I do agree that Bo2 would've been the best way to handle things but maybe their analytics showed that bo1 brings more money than bo2.
I think most of the viewers who have been around for quite a bit had more fun watching the earlier seasons and despite the main reason for that is that teams played a less tactical playstyle back then, the bo1 format was a lot more fun to watch because there were a larger number of upsets and it was easy to watch as a fan. You could be playing lol or doing something else on a weekend night and just hop on the stream to watch one game or two, the ones you want. Now sometimes your favourite teams don't even play all lcs days and sometimes you can't watch it because it's too late and you were busy watching a Liquid vs Echo Fox bo3...
well point 3 you can actually use as something that is good, improving the chances for upsets if teams dont pay attention.point 4 doesn't matter, korea has always had an other format than any other region, that doesnt make them weak.point 5 doesn't matter either. If something was good and you tried to improve on it and it didn't work then you better go back. So just saying we used to do that is not an argument. I agree with your first 2 points though, but i feel like the value of bo1 gets underrated.
i actually watch all the games.. sometimes its sleepy
TBH Bo1 is way more viewer-friendly, bo3 is too time-consuming for a non-hardcore fan like me that only tune into big matchup
Bo3s wasn't the reason for NAs improvement"When talking to some of the pros, the biggest gains in competitiveness have been due to coaching, support staff, and a more rigorous scrim culture. We're also working with the Players Association to continue to make improvements to scrim tools and Riot provided practice servers." - RiotBear

This reminds me of that story we told each other as kids about the ghost in the movie Three Men and a Baby. The kid in the drapes for no good reason. We would pause the tape at that moment and scream to ourselves.

Christmas of '02 all I wanted was an Xbox so I could play Halo at LAN parties with my friends. Instead I got a dumb old GameCube. I was sure my mom had made a mistaken and upon learning of it would laugh with me, we'd travel to the store and rectify the situation."Xbox games seemed so violent, I think this Gamebox will be much more fun!" I was crushed.I fuckin grew to love my GameCube, crazy taxi, Mario party, smash Bros melee, super Mario sunshine, Luigi's Mansion. Way more fun.
It was only the most sophisticated gaming experience ever created by humans.**AND** it's a cube!
How I feel about the Dreamcast. 
This image has been reposted more times than the Gamecube was bought. 
The GameCube didn't sell well? First I've heard. When I was a kid everyone in the neighborhood either had one or wanted one.

I got my first taste of Super Smash Brothers on this amazing machine. Those were the days.

Phantasy Star Online !I loved that game Jesus Christ 
I thought this was an /r/gamingcirclejerk post at first.
Some of my favorite GC memories are of playing Tales of Symphonia and Baton Katos.    The GC had some damn good RPGs.
Simpson's hit and run was my childhood GTA! Many hours spent on that brilliant cube
Favorite memory of Gamecube, buying Four Swords, with four GBA adapters, and getting my friends together to beat it. It took a loooooooong time, but was sooo worth it.Though, I still can't conceive of the person who thought "If any of the GBA's disconnect for more than 1 second, such as if the battery dies, the game should automatically quit back to the main menu without saving"
Mario Kart Double Dash.  This game was my shit back then.
This was the first system I saved my money and bought for myself. I will never forget Metroid Prime and Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles. And even though most people hate it I will always love Star Fox Adventures! Sadly I never actually got to play Wind Waker. 
The best part about the Gamecube for me when I got it was being able to transfer my Pokemon from Pokemon Ruby to Pokemon Colosseum and see them in 3D. It was dope AF. Mario Kart Double Dash, Super Mario Sunshine, Pokemon Colosseum, and Battalion Wars were the games I freaking loved.
You could play gameboy games on your TV with that attachment. That was the coolest thing ever to me. 
This again?
*were still
All I need is a damn controller and I can play Mario Sunshine
stop. reposting. this.

Pikmin for life.I visited my oldest friend last weekend and we sat around playing all the classic hits from our secondary school days. 
Pretty weird that it didnt sell well with how crazy popular smash still is.
don't worry guys, nintendo will come out with a gamecube mini anytime now
So many amazing games for this console...Metroid Prime, SSB Melee, Custom Robo, Luigi's Mansion, Zelda: Windwaker... 
dae gamecube ??!??!? XDddddd gib updootrs!
This sub needs to be renamed nintendocirclejerk.
They were awesome, just way too short. We bought Baldur's Gate for Christmas break one year. Planned on spending some quality time with the family playing it, we beat it in a day and a half. With going slow through any side things we could do and exploring.
Chibi robo ftw
Dat Sega Dreamcast tho!
Yo, Star Wars Bounty Hunter was so sick! I must have played that game through on GameCube like three or four times. Then I traded it into GameStop with like so many legendary games for about 11.00. When asked what game I wanted, I grabbed Star Wars Rouge Squadron. I dunno if you guys played Rouge Squadron but if you used Vaders Tie Fighter it was so cheap. His missiles are homing its so unfair, and honestly if he was equipped with those during Luke's miracle mile. I have no idea how the shit he couldn't take Luke down, literally one button bro, cmon haha. 
Zelda: Windwaker / Still tied with OOT for me...
Pandering horseshit
SUPER SMASH BROS. MELEE

(Saturn/Dreamcast owners) "That's cute."
Double Dash is the low key best Mario Kart out there. Summers, 3 Am, Mountain Dew Livewire, and piles of Dominoes pizza. That is childhood.

[Mine are always watching....](https://imgur.com/a/bogkH) 
I don't know why, even though i've always wanted one i never bought it. I remember being a kid and wanting so desperately to play Pokemon in 3D and would watch all these videos of it (was a crazy pokemon lover) and instead i go and get an xbox (halo edition too). Like what the heck? why didn't i get one of these, did they market it really bad or something?
KIRBY AIR RIDE WAS MY SHIT!
Mine died....
I had no idea it didn't sell well, my favorite games were on there, Mario Kart Double Dash, Animal Crossing, Super Mario Sunshine...
Mario Kart. I still play this regularly with my sister.
This is how I feel about my WiiU as well as my Game Cube. 
Resident Evil on this beast was amazing. 
<3 baten kaitos
Never get rid of my N64 nor Cube.
One word. Emulation.Go get your nostalgia now.
Still have mine and I just recently replayed Super Mario Sunshine.
this is the most virgin post i have ever seen on this sub
TIL the Game Cube didn't sell well 
In the thumbnail it looks like a Mr. Meeseeks hugging a Meeseeks box. 
Super Mario Sunshine. Cleaning up Delfino Plaza within the time limit. I had never known so much pressure and frustration.
Fire emblem path of radiance <3
The PS2 era was really the pinnacle of quality gaming for me.
Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life and sequel where you got to play as a woman - Harvest Moon: Another Wonderful Life!! Those were so relaxing and amazing. I needed both so I could marry the woman I had a crush on AND the man I had a crush on lol but damn those games were existential as fuck. They end with you having fulfilled your dead father‚Äôs dream, you die in your sleep of old age, surrounded by your wife and child. Aside from those games....Wind Waker, Sonic Adventure 2 Battle (for the Chaos), Luigi‚Äôs Mansion, Super Mario Sunshine, Paper Mario....But does anyone remember the more obscure games, like Billy Hatchet ??? 
Pikmin, Metroid Prime, Smash, Mario Sunshine, Agent Under Fire/Nightfire, Animal Crossing, Resident Evil 0, Viewtiful Joe, Wind Waker...
Atari jaguar man.. loved mine
I got a GameCube for Christmas from my wife last year. I was playing Metroid Prime last night and just encountered a Chozo Ghost for the first time. It's a great game. 
My favorite console as a kid was the Sega Genesis. I still go back and play me some Gunstar Heroes from time to time.
Spyrooooooioooooooo!!
Legend of Zelda: Master Quest
Sega Dreamcast is where it's where it's at. 
I feel the same about dreamcast ):
I still have my GameCube. I opened it up Christmas morning of 2001. I just turned 12. When I see pictures of kids opening up their Nintendo Switch it's like I know that feeling.Nintendo feels...üòçFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles  was amazing!
As a Star Wars fan, I absolutely loved that my Wii could play Gamecube and N64 games. Rogue Squadron, Jedi Knight, Bounty Hunter, Ep 1 Racer... all of them were amazing.
Double Dash is still the best Mario Kart next to 8.Fight me.
Really though since when did the consumer ever care how well the thing they bought sold in general? I mean really who gives a fuck other than the company that makes it? 
I had the PS2 like everyone else did because it rocked. Eventually I got a Gamecube for the sole purpose of playing Star Wars Rogue Squadron because fuck me those games were insanely awesome! Wound up getting Fire Emblem, Super Smash and a bunch of other games. I had the PS2 for 7 or more years and the Cube for just shy of 3, but I think I wound up with more hours on the Cube thanks to Star Wars and Smash.
Game cubes were extremely sturdy consoles of their time. I mean what kind of company promotes wireless controls though means of cleanliness.
I got my GameCube in 03 from my dad who was terrefied of my Health, I had  a lifethreatning case of yellow streptococci, but after a  week I got better, and as  motivation be bought me this. I got Windwaker  and Melee for it right away, best childhood  ever.
For the longest time  till about like..last year I didn't even realize that the GameCube was Nintendo's offering for the ps2 - Xbox era. I though it was just some random weird one off thing they did like what the wii U is. Like growing up the GameCube was virtually non existent to me.Now I see the generations like..Nintendo 64 - Ps1 Xbox - ps2 - Gamecube Xbox 360 - ps3 - WiiXbox one - ps4 - Switch
I miss Underground 2 just as much :(
To be honest, it kind of creeps me out when people identify so strongly with a brand they feel they need to comfort the corporation if a product of theirs doesn't sell well.It would be like Raytheon making a useless fighter jet the pentagon doesn't want, and some diehard defense nut puts together a picture of them hugging the fighter jet and sends it in a consolation letter to the company in question to let them know that "even if the fighter jet didn't do well, I still love you."
Maybe...it didn't sell well because it had shit games. Ever think of that?You could literally count the good games GC had on one hand, unfortunately that's not enough to keep a console afloat thru the test of time.
I'm convinced the gamecube had a larger consumer base than the Xbox.With the high failure rate of the Xbox, and the low failure rate of the gamecube a certain number of the xbox sales would in fact be repeat buyers.
Still the only console I've ever owned that hasn't given me a hard time. Biggest hiccup I've ever had was when 1 game froze for a whole 2 seconds. Great console and even the controller is terrific I find
It's comical to me that the worst console in gaming history gets this stupid nostalgia boost on the internet.There's not one redeeming quality about this POS console other than the fact it might have been under your xmas tree.
[GAMECUBE SONG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwrrwSmo0yU)
Most of my preteen years consisted of Tony Hawk‚Äôs Underground 2, Harry Potter Quiditch World Cup, and a LOT of NFS U2. 
Buy a backwards compatible Wii with component cables so you can have 480p (best picture quality) without paying shitloads for the official gamecube cables.  Or if you're dumb like me, you can buy a Wii that nerfed the backwards compatibility. I did unlock the function through homebrew  in the end.  So I run the GC games through a usb thumb drive and use a gamecube controller adapter for the Wii U smashbrothers. 
Still have one! I haven't played it in ages, but it definitely was great. And the tiny little disks were the cutest.
I still have mine 
I thought it didn't seem that poorly. Wasn't it comparable to the Xbox?
Windwaker!
If we get a GameCube Classic Edition it'll be interesting to see how much it sells in comparison to the original's release.
The success of a game is not measured in units sold. It is measured in how much it's loved.
I have the same feelings for the Turbografx 16 - the game system that used the same slim card for the console and handheld portable (no special versions on the go for us) *and* had a CD drive add on for the console plus TV tuner add on for the portable.  It was awesome.
GameCube was my second ever console, and my first of it's generation. I only got it because, at the time, Nintendo was the only company that hadn't already spoken publicly about replacing it. But it was a damn good console with some great games, and I have so much nostalgia for the games I played on it. Also, that controller. A third-party company needs to make controllers for modern system shaped like the GameCube controller. It's so good.
There's no way in fuck this didn't sell well 
Resident evil 4, F-zero gx, Metroid Prime, Zelda Wind Waker, Baten Kaitos... even though I still prefer the 64/snes personally, the high level of quality in the best gamecube games was mind blowing
Me and my roommates (juniors in college) play Mario kart double dash and super smash bros melee all the time
wish it lasted longer !! was so fun!
GameCube was my first and only game system. When I was younger I knew I wanted to play Final Fantasy, and when it was my birthday, my parents let me pick out a game system. Not understanding how games worked, I chose "that cube thingy". And that was when those two game systems (it was between PlayStation and GameCube if I recall) were the older ones. I saw the limited game choices and had regretted picking the GameCube. It was pretty cool when I got the Mario Party along with the system and it said Happy Birthday to me. It wasn't until I got Tales of Symphonia that I didn't regret my choice. I still have it. Still not finished with Fire Emblem because I want to keep everyone alive/get everyone. Won't complete Skies of Arcadia because I know it's sad ending and don't want to witness it. Slash, starting over again but not able to complete. I love those three games the most. 
For something that didn't sell well seems like everyone I know played GC
R.I.P. Billy Hatcher
Replace the Gamecube with a Dreamcast and I'd agree 100%. I will go to my grave with the firm belief that Sega should still be making consoles and Nintendo should be relegated to making 3rd party games.
I missed out.I wish I could go back to college and all my friends had GameCube instead of Xbox
NeedForSpeed Underground 2 on the gamecube is still my favorite racing game out there.

Best star wars games since pc x wing
I still have my GameCube, along with all the Legend of Zelda box set they released for it. Time to dig it out.
I still have mine! With original box, 3 additional controllers and the wavebird! I just sold all my GC games tho, with exception to Metroid Prime 1 & 2. A friend wanted to play the original (rather than the Wii version).
I always found it strange how people praised the system for it's physical size.  It was by far the most ill-fitting console I've ever owned.  The fact that it was tall then needed additional clearance on the top because it was top loading meant there was almost no normal entertainment cabinet that would fit it.  Then the GBA player made it even more tall.  No matter how large other consoles were they still basically fit the form factor of a VCR.  That thing spent it's life on the floor because of that rather than in the cabinet with all my other systems.
WE KNOW.. WE'VE HEARD
Phantasy star onlineOoh my what a game... 
Got two consoles. one in spare just in case. Game collection is not complete but good enough. And it's impossible to get the ones i need to add to it. Prices are high and going up. 
Well in a few years, maybe we‚Äôll get a Gamecube Classic. 
How I feel about the vita
I do this to my Dreamcast too. 
Rogue Squadron II and III and Pikmjn games were based
This is how I feel about my old Sega Saturn
I bought like 3 of those things.
Had mine stolen and pawned by an uncle when I was a little girl. I miss it every day :'(
Had a poorly designed controller,  SNES was the last decent nintendo controller.
I miss my PS2.
How I still feel about the Dreamcast.
I dreamt about the good old cube last night! Then I woke up to this post.. Amazing 
Super Mario Sunshine
Still has the best Soulcalibur.
Tales of Symphonia... 'nough said!http://www.gamerankings.com/gamecube/561316-tales-of-symphonia/index.html
Hell yes I will always love the GameCube!  Metroid Prime was always one of my absolute favorites, as well as Star Fox Adventures (I know, I know...) and Paper Mario: TTYD.  (Which I just started playing again!  =D)
Mini GameCube when?
Funnily enough I got mine out yesterday and played MarioParty. Fuck yea
It honestly blows my mind how the gamecube didn't sell well.  I was convinced it was a top tier console for my entire childhood because of how many hugely influential and popular games were on it.  Melee, Luigi's Mansion, Wind Waker, Super Mario Sunshine, the Sonic Adventure games, fucking PIKMIN, Animal Crossing, Paper Mario, Viewtiful Joe, and Resident Evil 4 to name a few.  This shit was my childhood.
It's probably the console I have the most good memories of. I was still pretty young for the SNES and N64, the NGC was the first console I could call my own.I still remember the Christmas I got it, the games I got alongsie it were the Zelda Collection that came with it, Super Mario Sunshine and Metroid Prime.
√ú
Should do an updated one with the Wii U because that is how I feel right now about it, although not quite on the same level as Gamecube.
I still play GameCube games on my Wii all the time. I'm playing the Ocarina of Time Master Quest at the moment, actually. 
It didn't sell well? Tf? Everyone got this 
Robotech was fun as fuck in my eyes
*are still awesome
Metroid Prime, XG3, Super Mario Sunshine...oh man, this thing was a huge part of my childhood!
Did nobody here play Animal Crossing or Harvest Moon A Wonderful Life?
I just dug out my GameCube after like a decade. Couldn't find the game I wanted to play :'( (Super Mario Sunshine)
Oh I loved Beyond Good And Evil
Take off the nostalgia glasses, there was probably a reason it didn't sell as good as other consoles.
The only time I really use my old home brewed Wii now is for gc games like smash and Mario kart cause it has the old controller ports and the wiimote just isn't the same in these
Best Mario kart was double dash on gamecube.I'd say it's my most loved game of all time.Mario kart double dash never let's you down!
It's always a shame when an outstanding product that some very passionate people put a lot of hard work into doesn't do as well as it should.
Basically me with the Wii U(I'm absolutely sure it will be liked just like the game cube in 10 years when we look back at its games)
Eternal Darkness is a very underrated game. The game fucks with you and tricked me more than I‚Äôd like to admit. For instance, you‚Äôll be in the middle of a fight and then the screen will go blank. You‚Äôll think it‚Äôs the TV but it‚Äôs just part of the gameplay. 
Any love for Metabots: Infinity? Last console release to my knowledge. Need another English release.
I like how the article says there are already too many theories, but here's another one!
Theres a similar theory about salty organic compounds becoming super concentrated in water ice too 
I guess this supports the idea that life started around geothermal vents. Those are compound and bubble rich environments.
When I think of multiverses I imagine bubbles out in space on a macro-scale. And within the bubbles is the stuff of the universe (stars, planets, galaxies). And I have no idea why.  
To understand just how immense this effect can be, read up on [Sonoluminescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoluminescence).
Is it possible to learn this power?

It's like in the book by Peter Sloterdiijk: https://www.amazon.de/Bubbles-Spheres-I-Peter-Sloterdijk/dp/1584351047/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1506770197&sr=8-1&keywords=sloterdijk+bubbles
AHHHHHH We are in a bubble?!SELL SELL SELL
System of a Down were right - life *is* in a bubble jungle. 
But where did the bubbles come from?
[removed]
Why is ACSH still an accepted source when they are described as an ‚Äúanti-science trade group‚Äù by people like Naomi Oreskes?
Oh wow, I read the whole article ! Finally....
Almost like a... Big bang?
[Earth life may have originated in superheated collapsing bubbles, but who do you think put the mantis shrimp here in the first place?](http://i.imgur.com/lLxCoWM.jpg) 
Could you take that even farther and say the big bang could be due to a bubble?  
All we are is dust in the wind... 
So that's why bubbly water tastes so much better than normal! It's full of life.
‚ÄúMay have‚Äù and ‚Äúcould‚Äù are  my favorite click-bait keywords
I feel that if a collapsing bubble can be the spark of life, basically anything can. This feels 0 closer to actually discovering the origins of life. Edit: I stand, humbly corrected
I feel like this is something that will be in a history book labeled as a major discovery that was overlooked.
Sounds interesting. After all, the reaction just needs the activation energy.

The Netherlands is a mesmerizing place.  After a vacation there, I seriously considered moving.
This is from a festival called "Intents Festival". It's a very popular Hard Dabce festival. For an even crazier version look up "Defqon.1" where about 60,000 people do this.

Making new land?
This is the "platte dans" (lit. flattening dance), an annual event in the Netherlands where Dutch people come together at sites that have a higher elevation than the national average. The purpose of the platte dans is to lower the elevation of these sites by - quite literally - stomping them down via mass dancing in order to maintain the Netherlands's characteristic flatness.
What a crowd control!!

The power of hardstyle
Monkey see, monkey do.Anyone who thinks that man didn‚Äôt evolve from monkeys just has to see this proof.

If you look at the crowd it gives you a fairly good idea of how long it takes the brain to process something over a certain distance.
I will never have this much power.
I hate crowds. This is seriously fucking with my anxiety, looks a lot of fun, I just don't think I'd be able to be a part of it :(
And not a single black was seen that day.

Are people rapidly entering and leaving your discord voice channel?
Start watching the news because if he needs to lay low for a while, some serious shit is about to go down 
Ask him to accompany me to my next job interview.
Complain to the college for putting three people in a two-bed dorm room.
I would warn him that my kids were going to drive him bat shit crazy.
I'd pull my ball out of the garage, raise my adjustable hoop up to 8 feet and tell him to prepare to be schooled.
Obama: "Hello templefugate, I'm ah, here to stay for a bit. I can't pay you much, but ah, for the time being, I ah, brought this pizza."Me, Jimming the camera: "Thanks Obama"Cue laugh track.
Panic clean the house. 
Tell him I would have to ask my parents.
Nice try, Barack.
Wonder why he was here in rural England, but go put the kettle on
Only if you tell me what's the deal with aliens 
I would start a YouTube channel with him called 'Living with Barack', and we'd document our lives together as best friends.
Obama: Can you accomodate me in your house for next few weeks?Me: Yes......we can
We'd stay up late, tell scary stories and in the morning......... I'm makin waffles!
I'd probably suggest watching a Mel Brooks movie, cause I have a box set. It's gonna be awkward if he chooses Blazing Saddles tho.EDIT: y'all motherfuckers need to lay off the porn.
He can have my bed but my cat will walk on his tits to wake him up in the morning. 
Hide all of my Michelle fakes.
1st- Probably freak the hell out, mainly because I haven't cleaned up and also because it's freaking Barack Obama2nd- Wonder where Michelle and his three kids are (Joe Biden is included in this) Also wonder what is in  the suitcase- hmmm...3rd- Introduce him to everything Aussie- take him to the beach, give him some thongs, bordies and a singlet. Make sure he slaps on some sunscreen and a hatHe will return to America knowing a whole other language and rich knowledge of an awesome country.
Alone? Like, he had a dispute with his wife or something?...I mean, I guess I wouldn't ask questions, but it's ok if he takes my bed and I can temporarily sleep on the couch. I'm sure if he's chosen my house that there's the chance he wants to talk to me about something important or unimportant during that time. I'd leave that conversation to him, though.Shit. Maybe he chose my house specifically because he somehow knew there'd be no questions asked.
He and I are both left-handed mixed race Democrats raised by single mothers, born on August 4th and started our college careers outside of Los Angeles while being huge baseball fans.I'd assume he's here to finish what I've been suspecting all along- there can be only one.
Welcome him in with open arms and just be happy that someone actually wants to spend time with me. I'm only slightly lonely. 
Aren't you, like, a millionaire?
Take pictures recreating every Obama/Biden meme with me as Biden.Gotta get me some rocking aviators 
I'd ask him what his favorite beer was, go and get it, and get him legitimately drunk. Then I'd ask him his real opinion of Donald Trump. Then I'd ask him about his real opinion of Hillary Clinton. 
"I Mean you could ask nicely instead of demanding.""uhh... *Clears throat* Can I stay here for a few weeks?""And..?""Please..""Yeah man, guest room is to your left second door on the right"
Id probably let him in. Wouldn't really surprise me. Ever since that time Bob Saget showed up with a surgically grafted horse dildo and asked if I wanted to watch an episode of Full Horse, not much surprises me.
Charge him for the stay and use the money to vacay solo-dolo cuz I'd rather be Obamaself
Wonder why he's hiding in the middle of nowhere, France, then ask him if he wants a drink.
Order pizza and spark a j with my prez
Id make the former president some waffles. It has always been my dream tio give waffles to the president 
Load the nice bong instead of the crappy one
Do the same as I'd do with any of the living former Presidents - invite them in, tell 'em to have a seat and get comfortable. I would also warn him that we have parrots and they're all flighted and he *will* get a visit from at least one of them fairly quickly.To be honest, of the current living group, Obama and W are the two that seem like they'd be the most interesting to talk to.
Double check that it's not an evil guy who's taken a polyjuice potion.
Only admit him if he allows endless "*Thanks Obama*" jokes.Dude's a riot though, so I imagine he won't mind.
High-fives all around.  Break out the booze."This is our room, Mr. President, and there's the air mattress.  You may like it even though it def--kidding! Kidding.  We're kidding.  You can have our bed.  We'll rename it the Presidential Suite."*four hours later*"So seriously, why DID you keep deporting so many people?"
He would be pretty desperate to show up at the door of a rural conservative so I'd probably show some southern hospitality and let him in.
I'd be calling my boss and telling her I was taking the next two weeks off, and if she has a problem with it, to reference the selfie I made with my house guest and sent to her.
"Hey Barack, long time no see. Where are Michelle and the girls ?" 
Prepare him for the loaded questions my grandparents would ask him but then take a few moments with him and ask him if they're hiring at Area 51 and network my way up the chain of command until I become a high key political figure and at the age of 44 become the first female president. Gotta think about the bigger picture here.
I'm a Republican, so I'd be confused, but I'd definitely let him chill out 
I didn't vote for Obama, nor do I agree with most of his political views. But damn does that dude seem like he would be fun to hang out with. He can totally sleep in my guest bedroom for a few weeks.
I would joke and tell him he's taking a big risk with this in rural Texas, but he chose the right house. Come on in and have a drink. Hungry?
‚ÄúOkay... but you‚Äôre player two.. and that controller is a little busted‚Äù
I'd be fucking stoked. 
"I wasn't aware *this* was how you spied on people"
Keep him waiting for a bit while Michelle gets dressed and leaves by the back door. I'm not an animal
Start cleaning, because geez...
I'd shut the door. I don't take in illegal immigrants. Canada has rules. 
Let him in and treat him well for however long he stays.Then immediately put him on my resume as a reference and apply for my dream job. 
I'd just say "Fine, but you're gonna have to crash on the couch with my dog."  If he's cool with that, then hell yeah, I'd let Obizzle surf my couch.
"So... Michelle givin' you hell about something? Did you forget about an anniversary? Well, come on in, you know I've always got a pull-out couch, a glass of sweet tea, and a cheese sandwich for you or Joe. Don't forget to wipe your feet on the mat!"
I'd welcome him in with open arms. I live in a two-room dorm suite with no roommate. He can stay all damn year if he helps me study for my international relations midterms.
If I didn't faint, I'd check my meds to make sure I hadn't accidentally taken some combo that gives me auditory and visual hallucinations. Then, I'd call him in and call my mother who would freak the fuck out. She LOVES him.
I‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúLet me be clear, the Chinese leftovers are not for you. There will be, uh, a teaching moment for you if you touch them.‚Äù
Ask him what's in the suitcase. 
Invite his ass in! I‚Äôm hardcore conservative but I respect the office of the president and would love to have a conversation with him if he wouldn‚Äôt mind. Otherwise we would probably just watch Netflix. 
Welcome him in, and let him crash! Maybe pick his brain a little bit! Although I doubt I have enough room for his detail, but I could make it work! 
I‚Äôd load up my range bag and take him to my local gun club.  Fire some rounds down range and have a blast, then come home, have a few beers and get his perspective on life.
I'd roll up a blunt and we'd chill out to some tunes. Dude seems like a good guest. Also I'd go to social media to brag that I can't be racist because I have a black friend now. 
Oh Hi Barack
Ask for the rent up front. Former President or not, I don't accept freeloaders.
He seems like a chill guy. I wouldn't mind having him around for a week.
I would probably say "ok" and go back to Overwatch.
Clear out the spare room and prep for the most interesting few weeks of my life. He's an interesting guy that's had experiences few people will ever experience so he'd be awesome to sit down and talk with.

I didn't know it was on the banned substance list.  Wasn't Nate Diaz openly smoking CBD oil after one of the McGregor fights at the post-fight presser?
welcome to the 21st century finally
cbd is a medically legit anti-inflammatory. Can't wait to see where it eventually is used by actual medical practice. 
[USADA to Diaz brothers right now](https://i.imgur.com/XA7cbFY.jpg)
Is it tough to get 100% CBD without THC? or are we about to get a bunch of people popped for THC from bad extractions/contamination or whatever
Rubbin' oil with da booiiiizzz

# WARDIAZ
  USADA did something that will actually help more fights occur? This must be a dream. 
/u/buzznights or any other mod.  This hit r/all at some point and we're getting a lot of outside questions, and I think people assuming that CBD has been removed from some type of government list and not realizing USADA(United States Anti Doping Agency) is a sports doping regulatory agency, in this case for the UFC. CBD is now removed entirely from the banned list(was previously allowed out of competition, just not in) in sports that USADA tests for.  Meaning that athletes can use CBD "in competition" which covers the several hours after a fighter competes.  CBD could help with inflammation as well as pain management, and does not have the psychoactive properties of THC(the component in weed that gets you "high"). 
Sorta surprised motherfuckers
Today, young Vitor, CBD. Tomorrow, TRT.
Kelvin has no hope of ever getting to welterweight now 
NICK DIAZ IS BACK.
Only if it isn't federally illegal to have. CBD oil is classified as a Schedule 1 Substance in the United States. Even though cocaine and crystal meth areally schedule 2. 
Cbd joints with tha bois
What's next? Milkshakes?
Can anyone answer this, don't want to be a guinea pig. Will you test positive in a drug test with CBD use?  Is it just the source you get it from and how well it is extracted from the plant or is there always going to be THC in it? Would love to use it but I have a class a commercial licence and as long as federal ding dongs are keeping marijuana illegal I habe stayed away from it. 
WAR DIAZ
The Diaz brothers are happy tonight 
Thank fucking god. I have to use this shit instead of Advil because Advil gives me hypertension. Running around with bitch aches is stupid when there‚Äôs an oil you can take to relieve it. 
420 where you at motherfucker!
I wanna welcome Nate and Nick back to the octagon. Real talk tho CBD should've never been a banned substance. 
Jeff Novitzky more like Jeff YES-LITzky
Now we need the DoD to follow suit. Fat freakin chance but one can pray...
All jokes aside, this is great news. 
SMOKE WEED EVERY DAY!
I heard Bas Rutten talk about how great it was on his podcast. However I never heard of it before, can anyone fill me in on how it works?Edit: also I really want to buy some so if someone has a good site to use I would love to hear it. I hurt my shoulder and the doctor has just been giving me anti inflammatories that aren't that effective. I feel like this might work.
Awesome news. About time. Can't wait for a 3 hour JRE episode devoted to this topic!
Maybe we'll see the return of Matt Riddle to the UFC?
Wait it was banned? Ive seen it sold everywhere?
What benefit would THC even offer to be considered a PED? 
This is GREAT news! Now if we can just get THC off of any illegal list.. That'd be great too.
CBD helps protect the brain from possible head trauma before an athlete competes. Excited to see the UFC do this. Hopefully it opens the door for other sports (NFL, NHL, etc) to take a similar approach to brain health. 
If I was a stoner... which I am... and I was a professional fighter.. which I'm not.. I'd smoke a fat bong load of CBD crystals(usually cost ~$100/g) before a fight.
As it should be. CBD has no perfomance enhancing effects, it helps reduce inflammation, increase recovery and is overall good for the sport. Everyone should be taking CBD instead of ibuprofen and tylenol all the time. Even taking one ibuprofen a week is awful for you.
Doping now has no dope
this is really good news. i'm not a weed booster by any means, but the best part about CBD is that you can control, very minutely, how much of a dose you are getting vs something like an Advil NSAID. it helps with sleep and pain relief by miles, not to mention anxiety (for many people, but not all).the low THC bred bud has very little psychoactive potential so you can take it and still be day to day functional, if needed.
Can you test for CBD anyways?
I'm not surprised motherfuckers
DUDE
Good.
Progress is progress.
Awesome ! ! 
#WEEEEEEEEEEEDUH
War Diaz!!!!
Good work USADA.
fuck yea.  
thanks nate
Hopefully weed gets taken too, also is not a performance enhancer.
About time
Can it be used to masked other banned substance? 
so anywhere can use CBD only (no thc) medicines?
Good. All it does is relieve anxiety with NO high. 
What a huge step. Wow. 
Good
Then why am I still not being hired because I have marijuana in my system, even though I have a medical recommendation? 
Good for you!
Pharmaceutical Co. make lots of money. They want to protect their interests. But there‚Äôs fabric. Hemp is very durable, require min. water and is a nitrogen fixer, then building materials, paper, oils and lubricants from the seed, and on...
Couldn't CBD be used as a painkiller in competition? 
Can we add elbow sharpeners, finger straighteners, groin-seeking knee modifications, and for god's sake, please, these logo-oilers to the list as well, then? Thanks!
ITT: Diaz vs McGregor confirmed (apparently)
Max "CBD" Holloway will love this.
Can CBD really be totally isolated from THC ? Sorry outta the loop 
So for non-doctors here, what is cbd?
This is kind of useless overall, due to the fact that most CBD sources also have trace amounts (or more) of other chemicals that are in fact banned by WADA. 
About time, my friend fought recently, high as fuck on codeine, 300mg of it, he didnt get caught out by ASADA or anything... my turn next ;) <3 you opiates.
REVOLUTIONARY, in remembrance of this date Edgy Brah will fly all of his rubber guards at half mast.  
Im not surprised mother fuckers.
Serious question? What is the best (self regulated trusted)cbd oil, besides the enormously over priced "spiderweb" pig loving one,that I can get and order without a card for my 81yr old dad that has parkingsons, just looking for a brand I should take serious and order from.
I'm kinda surprised motherfuckers. 
MMA fighting: ‚ÄúNate and Nick Diaz are both in new negotiations to return to the octagon in the ufc ‚Äù
well,  I've been seeing CBD gummies in gas stations all over NY and NJ for the past year. 
Isn‚Äôt this fairly monumental?If I‚Äôm understanding this right, fighters can smoke as much heefer as they want now? It‚Äôs an ethical and logical step, guys will be less afraid to use it and may look towards it for helping recovery instead of legit PEDs.
at last
I hope this brings the price down
Can anyone tell the abbreviations?
So they can smoke weed now? 
I can now store my shit on my desk in my dorm, in plain sight?
What does this mean for drug testing for employment in the US? 
Getting 100% legally high as fuck.
The WADA statement says "cannabidiol extracted from cannabis plants may also contain varying concentrations of THC, which remains a prohibited substance." **So only synthetic CBD is legal, not CBD from cannabis.** I hope a fighter doesn't read the title of this post and assume all CBD is legal now.  
My chiropractor just gave me a sample yesterday? It's been unbanned for awhile I think. He s been using it himself. Works great by the way. 
CBD = weed 
Warning to kids. Do not tweet or share this or you will be taken seriously and serious things will happen.
They didn‚Äôt even take that gun picture. You can see a pretty blatant watermark in the top right of the gun picture 
Yeah I don't think this is a good idea.
Here in Italy we have school tambien el sabado :(.I mean me too grazieedit: TIL i live in Spain
*reference to columbine**lol*
A 1911 has to be among the least efficient school shooter firearms. Lots of recoil and a very low capacity magazine. He would do better with a Glock
Nice counter tops! What were you saying again?
I honestly wonder how many kids got in trouble for posting school shooting memes, now that they are so popular.

This resignation puts the list of notable departures as follows:- Sally Yates, Acting Attorney General (1/30)- Mike Flynn, National Security Adviser (2/13)- Preet Bharara, US Attorney, SDNY (3/11)- Katie Walsh, WH Deputy Chief of Staff (3/30)- James Comey, FBI Director (5/9)- Mike Dubke, WH Communications Director (5/30)- Marc Kasowitz, Personal Attorney of DJT (7/20)- Mark Corallo, Top Spokesman for Kasowitz (7/20)- Sean Spicer, WH Press Secretary (7/21)- Michael Short, WH Senior Assistant Press Secretary (7/25)- Reince Priebus, WH Chief of Staff (7/28)- Anthony Scaramucci, Communications Director (7/31)- George Gigicos, Deputy Assistant to the President & Director of Advance Operations (7/31)- Ezra Cohen-Watnick, Senior Director for Intelligence on National Security Council (8/2)- Steve Bannon, WH Chief Strategist (8/13)- Andy Hemming, WH Rapid Response Director (8/21)- Sebastian Gorka, Deputy Assistant to the President and Strategist (8/25)- Keith Schiller, Director of Oval Office Operations (9/20)- Chuck Rosenberg, Acting DEA Director (9/29)- Tom Price, Secretary of Health & Human Services (9/29)Edit: updated the list with a few names (Hemming, Schiller, Rosenberg)
How many Mooch's was that?
Remember, Trump publicly promised to fire this guy if the Obamacare repeal failed. The private flight shit is just convenient cover, IMO
President Trump should also resign for spending tens of millions of taxpayer dollars so that he, his family, members of his administration, and members of his Secret Service can spend countless weekends at his luxury resorts and high-rise hotels. President Trump even takes the abuse one step further than Price because in Trump's case he bills the government the "market rate" for accommodations that *he owns*. So he's effectively lining his own pockets with taxpayer money. Unbelievably swampy activity and a total abuse of power -- this motherfucker needs to be impeached faster than it took Price to resign/be fired...and that means we need to elect a Democratic Congress in 2018, because the GOP have proven they won't do a damn thing about this horrible excuse for a presidency. 
Anybody think he was fired not because of the abuse of tax payer money, but because they failed again to repeal Obamacare and Trump found out he can‚Äôt fire Mitch?
uh oh, religious right base [not gonna be happy about this.](https://twitter.com/tperkins/status/913523657728598017)
Every time a member of the administration leaves, Oompa Loompas should come out and sing a song about the dangers of gluttony and greed.
I hope this son of a bitch has to take the bus back to Georgia. SEE YA!
Na Na Naa Naa, Na Na Naa Naa 
This has to be one of the dumbest sagas ever.February: Leaves Congress to become Health Secretary.May: Seat narrowly stays in Republican hands after tens of millions of dollars spent. Worth it though because now he's health secretary and kept the seat?September: Cabinet Secretary leaves. Refill secretary job with current occupant of GA-6.Rinse and repeat.
30.3 Mooches.edit: looks he was confirmed Feb 10, so 23 Mooches
It's so hard to keep track of Trump administration scandals that I was thinking this was  [U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/08/21/treasury-secretarys-wife-boasts-of-travel-on-government-plane-touts-hermes-and-valentino-fashion/?utm_term=.2a7f2c9aa5d4) getting fired for this issue but this is a different secretary getting fired for the same thing - the health and human services secretary.**So when does U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin 'resign' for this very issue?** I'm looking forward to that so people can tweet snarky stuff at his wife.
Okay, now how about doing the same for Zinke and Pruitt?
No. Please. Stop, don't go. 
He paid the ultimate Price
A day in the life of an argument with a Trump supporter - "Trump's administration is a complete and utter joke""No it's not!""How so?""He's making America great again!""Okay, how?""By taking things that were once not great and making them great!""Like what?""Like America!"Scene.
Another one bites the dust...
Cue the megathread and a legion of Trump supporters going all in on 'whatabout whatabout whatabout!'
Where are all the folks from the other thread calling the private jet usage "fake news" because it was a shareblue article?
Time for him to reimburse in full.
Private jet: $500,000Resigning from HHS : PricelessFor everything else, there's mastercard
If only people in senate warned us...
The best people, believe me!  Also, he probably got fired because the healthcare bill didnt pass, not because he was getting free flights on taxpayers dime...
Now you, orange creep
Good riddance.
If only those taxpayer dollars could be added to Medicare and Medicaid instead of private jets
Yet another career ground up and spit out by Trump's reverse-Midas touch.Not that he didn't deserve it... but when are people going to learn?
"Her current scandals and controversies will continue throughout her presidency and we will make it honestly, look, it's gonna be virtually impossible for her to govern. " - Trump Nov 2015
Goddamn. I find watching the republicans prove, over and over, that they don't actually care about anything that they use to sell themselves to the general public simultaneously arousing and intensely frustrating. It's like political blue balls, because the payoff _should_ be that voters stop electing these terrible people, but that doesn't seem to be happening 
why don't we have the same outrage over the amount of money (in the millions) that Trump is costing taxpayers when he goes to his private golf courses and makes a profit on them using public office?
There are now enough oustings from this administration to fill a verse of "We Didn't Start The Fire."
Coming from the guy who routinely travels to his own resorts, and whose wife flew in a separate plane behind him.2017 sucks.
Trump is gonna plunge the US into another recession.
Trump fired Price for spending $1 million on charter flights. Meanwhile he's spent over $70 million dollars golfing, including this weekend.
Price's pricey private planes portray president's people poorly; populance properly pissed
So why is he allowed to resign instead of being taken out in cuffs for stealing from the country?  Rhetorical, but come on
I feel like there is a disconnect between President Trump's promise to hire the best people and the actual quality of some of the people he has hired.  
Just the kleptocracy in action. Business as usual.  Their hypocrisy is utterly blinding, but I guess that doesn't matter as long as Republican voters keep their eyes closed.  Turmp riding the Obama's for acting well within the expectations of first families, then coming in a taking advantage of every situation for their own profit.  The era of stupidity and unbridled greed in America has really come to full fruition. This one clown will take a fall so that Turmp, his entitled kelptocrat family and the rest of his cabinet (including mnuchin who chartered a private jet on taxpayers to show his hollywood wife a view the eclipse atop fort knox) can keep living it up on taxpayer dollars while giving millionaires and billionaires the lions share of tax relief and preaching about how we can't afford to pay for health care.  Price is not the exception, he's just the scape goat.  
THIS is what it takes? This isn't among the top ten abuses of power for this administration. This probably isn't even the top ten power abuses of this administration that we've learned about this WEEK. 
"The best, people folks. Believe me." 
Don‚Äôt forget the Senate had to confirm Price. Go back and read some choice republicans in favor of price.Every republican senator who voted yes on Price should have their judgement under scrutiny because it was well known at the time Price had acted unethically while in congress.> Democrats said that Mr. Price, a House member since 2005, had shown bad judgment by actively trading shares of medical and pharmaceutical companies while shaping health policy in Congress.Once again Republicans put party over country and look what happen! This is a perfect example. For all you R voters who just trying to get by pay check to paycheck. Raise a strong family with christian values. This is what your votes bring. These politicians on the R side aren‚Äôt looking out for you.
OK. He's gone. Can we now talk about the bigger news they want to bury? http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-senate/trump-has-not-begun-implementing-russia-sanctions-law-senators-idUSKCN1C42YF?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=Social
Just a reminder that Trump is heading to golf this weekend despite everything and it will cost us more than Tom Price did.
If Obama upsized his fries at Five Guys the republicans would of drawn up articles of impeachment.
So this dude got a job in February, spent a ton of other people's money, didn't do his job, and didn't even show up for most of his job because he was busy spending other people's money and making design decisions about opening up an expensive, executive dining hall? And claims he is a fiscal conservative? I get it that we live in an alternate timeline now (Where Trump becomes POTUS and it's the Berenstein Bears) but I'm constantly amazed how these people can get away with murder (literally in many cases) like no consequences whatsoever.
Dare I say it?  Over Priced ?
"The 62-year-old Price, a former House member from Georgia, was a prominent critic of Obamacare while serving in Congress. He also had billed himself as a staunch fiscal conservative with a record of pushing for government spending discipline."Oh, such is ~~irony~~ hypocrisy.
This is barely even political - who, regardless of their political leaning, can justify $1,000,000 in six months on private flights? That's outrageous. As ever, those who spend the most time talking about wasteful government spending seem to be those who are best at it.
Why does Trump keep firing "the best people, the best" that he hired?
> "I have spent forty years both as a doctor and public servant putting people first. I regret that the recent events have created a distraction from these important objectives," Price wrote.You piece of shit. You don't regret your malfeasance; you regret getting noticed for it.I can't believe that we, the voting population, have allowed our current governmental/political situation to come into being.
Who would have thought that if you remove ethical oversight from an administration, that administration tends to hire unethical people?
No one can beat the speedrun time set by the MOOCH. 
I'm betting he doesn't reimburse the government now...I hope journalists track stuff like these commitments so they're called on it.Especially when Trump says he's "100%" willing to testify and rebut Comey's claims under oath.
Why don't these scumbags go to jail? Steal public money, commit crimes and go scot free. I'm sure he has tons of offers in the private sector already.
It's crazy we're living in a time where people are preaching about being patriotic and respecting the flag but the same people wouldn't lift a finger for dying Americans.Those same people preach about our economy and how Obama ruined it, and how Trump is fixing our government. Yet they ignore this blatant abuse of power and money.What a time.
First rule of Trump Club: Don't get caught.
We pick the best people, don't we? 
One of the only benefits of all the smoke this year: really cool sunsets
Are there really any wrong turns in Yosemite?
A wrong turn lead me to a field of flowers and suddenly I'm second guessing every wrong turn in my life - can't remember where I got this quote sorry
That's truly an extraordinary photo.
yer in a river now harry
This is like the exact description of the scene of the book I'm reading... Made my day!  Thank you.
adventure begins when plans end
Looks like a meteor flying towards earth
I‚Äôve been here. There‚Äôs also a set or stairs in the middle of nowhere a little off on the bank on the right.It‚Äôs so weird and beautiful in this part. I sat by the bank near the stairs and I swear everything went silent for a while. Then my friend came to me and took me with him.
Stunning 
Found my new wallpaper! Amazing shot!
Fire in the sky
Like a river that don't know where it's flowin', I took a wrong turn and I just kept goin. 
Reminds me of The Good Dinosaur.
Damn....that is a stunning image.
Is there ever a wrong turn in Yosemite
I'd never call that a wrong turn. I mean, maybe if you ran into a weird cult or something, it were late for a wedding, but that's a great shot. 
I feel at peace when I see this.
Keep taking pictures, because one day it might be the only thing we have to remember it.
Smoky as fuck!
Beautiful sunset
I want to fish this spot.
Where is the wrong turn at? An Arctic Turn??
Are you stuck now? Need someone to tow your truck?
I always see Yosemite National Park on here, makes me wanna go..
Beautiful I would love to fish there 
We made a wrong turn once and saw a jaguar in the wild. No pictures - digital camera took too long to boot up.
I need to make it back there...
Did you use a phone to take the picture? If so, what phone is it?
Thanks for providing me my new wallpaper!
Photobombing tree. üòé
Oh that's too serene 
This picture was probably taken on the planned direction (or turn). Or maybe there was no direction planned out to begin with. Saying "beautiful wrong turn" is probably a lie created simply to provide a more catchy title.

Hope this will be visible. Been a while since I saw a comet.
Anyone know how visible it'll be from earth yet?
Who wants to hitchhike on this one? I'm down for a interstellar voyage with a gang of rowdy space cowboys.  
And .... has NASA made the call to Harry Stamper and the best deep core drilling team on the planet?  Stamper has been drilling holes in the earth for thirty years. And he never, never missed a depth that he aimed for. And by God, he's not gonna miss this one, he will make 800 feet.  While true that Stamper is handicapped by a natural immaturity, his daughter forgave him.  So let's get the best damn deep core drilling team in a couple of titanium space shuttles and blow this shit up before it hits zero barrier.
In community college I got an A in astronomy -- loved the teacher and material, but still when I come across fascinating articles like this my mind jumps to little baby Elijah Wood trying to save his gf from a giant sea wave. The article is a quick read for anyone curious. TLDR the comet and its coma get more and more cool to look at the closer it gets to the sun. It's not going to obliterate is. 
Hughes astros fan for the next two days right here!
ELI5: the difference between a comet, asteroid, meteorite, etc
This is pretty cool and all but the big question that remains untouched in this article is, "what has caused this rock to change trajectory?". Just thinking of newtons laws it seems intuitive to say that it would stay in the Oort Cloud unless acted upon by an outside force. Possibly a larger planetary body or something having a gravitational effect passing through our outer solar system.
Hubble is the gift that just keeps on giving.One of the best bits of PR for space programs there is.
Dave did some imaging with our observatory last week.  We looked at this comet and ~20 others.  It was a very cool program and that target was especially interesting.  He was pretty stoked about it.
Is an "active" comet one that's currently in orbit around the sun, as opposed to a comet that has been thrown off trajectory or impacted a planet or moon?
Why is it that they can't turn the hubble around to film earth?I'd love to know if anyone can help.Also. Why can't I find a real picture of halleys comet?Can anyone hook me up please?
Wonder what caused it to leave the Oort Cloud on a 1 way ticket into the solar system. If perhaps it was knocked by another large object, also on its way towards Earth...
According to scientists‚Äô predictive calculations, the comet won‚Äôt strike Earth until 2022. 
I seen a Mercury Comet one time.. or was it  a Ford Maverick..
This is how independence day (the good one) started isn't it? 
But how do they know  it's the comet's first trip into the solar system? Doesn't the tail disappear every time it's moving away from the sun?
What is an 'active' (as, opposed to 'inactive')  comet? I'm going to guess from the context of the article it has something to do with the coma.
So Bruce Willis has time to prepare for this one?
There goes Haleys, that rotten comet.It makes me sick, I want to vomit.
I wish I was able to comprehend space jargon and for that matter everything else that‚Äôs taken for granted. There is so much in the world I don‚Äôt fully understand.... I wish I was much smarter
Oddly enough, I am reading Gregory Benford's 1980 novel Shiva Descending right now and suspected I would soon see a report about something new incoming...
One day the Hubble telescope will be considered a pile of shit after the James Webb telescope is online, and nobody will blink an eye otherwise.:(

How big the Halo will be when it reaches Mars's orbit? 10-20x the size of Earth? Wouldn't that be huge in the sky? 
There's definitely a spaceship hidden behind this one. Who wants to find it with me?
News headlines tomorrow: "WORLD DESTROYER: HUBBLE SPOTS COMET - COULD THIS BE THE DOOM OF HUMANITY?"

I've lived in Taipei since '03.  [101 was less than half finished](https://imgur.com/a/1GTyW) when I got here.  Great city, great people, and 101 is a truly impressive structure.  Edit (bonus shots from my apartment in Taipei):[Under a full moon](https://imgur.com/WpI8qSX)[Sunrise over 101](https://imgur.com/a/iaV6o)

The original artist is [Romain Trystam](https://www.behance.net/romaintrystram). He does a lot of this cool neon geometric art.
Is it weird that my first thought when hearing "Taipei 101" is the Artemis Fowl book were they go to the building?
I've been up to the top of Taipei 101. The entire city sits below you as if you're in an airplane. It's wild.
[Here](https://imgur.com/a/ha7vb) is one of my 101 shots from 2012
Looks like stacked Chinese takeout orders
https://i.imgur.com/fYdbhRU.jpgThis is the giant testicle (damper) that hangs on the inside of the building near the top. It weighs tons and its purpose is to keep the building from swaying in strong winds and earthquakes, I believe. We made lots of jokes from that point forward on our trip about relieving our personal damper babies while traveling through Asia. 
I live in Taipei and I've done the stairclimb up Taipei 101 three times and can attest that that building is indeed evil.
https://imgur.com/gallery/P0Oxj
r/outrun would love this!
The top floor has an adorable video that explains how the building avoids swaying in the wind too much with a huge damper ball.https://youtu.be/1kwMnB0PAVQDamper babies FTW! 
Holy shit, I just changed my wallpaper to that earlier today
This looks like something from a Pok√©mon game
I'm living in Taipei at the moment, I see this building every day! :)
Did anybody else think Ready Player One?
Reminds me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grUOh701RPk). (Hanoi instead of Taipei, but yeah)
I love Taipei 101! It‚Äôs beautiful and inspiring. 
Is this available in a 1080 x 1920 resolution?It's gorgeous, and I'd love it for a wallpaper.
I think this is by beeple 
It really is an impressive view at the top as well, 
/r/outrun
Hey I have a version of this for my screen saver on my laptop. It‚Äôs an awesome image
Nice. I hate that place. From here it looks good though.
/r/outrun
101 is a great building 
I went into this mall when my family was renewing our visa years ago. It was so big that I swear the top was above the clouds.
I have this as my wallpaper, just a different colour 
This would make a cool poster
Must be Monday in the picture.The 101 changes through the colors of the rainbow when it lights up at night.

Hardly looks realistic at all, looks like some sorta retro video game
I think he just momentarily forgot the guy's last name, and ad libbed a little self deprecating bit from it. 
Excellent. Harrison Ford always has such epic comedic timing. From the first titter from the audience he played this masterfully. 
Another great Graham Norton bit is when [Will Ferrell did his Harrison Ford impression](https://youtu.be/n8dO9PcfEDQ).
Mirrorhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2BVEGQcF0&t=
Mr. Ford just likes fucking with people.  
I feel sorry for the people in the comments that dont get Ford's sense of humor 
That was a bit people.
Harrison Ford is able to go back on talk shows now that he's older because his personality comes off as less abrasive and more silly old man.
He is high all the time. 
Good old Tennyson Ford.
Hey Ryan, don't ride in his plane...
This episode was great. Margot Robbie live tattooing a random dudes foot 
thank god this is back. It is spectacular hangover viewing
I hope we don't see this reappear in a couple years when its announced he has dementia.
Can't blame him, it's not like that guy is famous or something.
Best talk show out there.Seriously none of the other ones come even close to Graham
He forgot the first time. The rest was a bit.
Let's not forget credit to Gosling. simple, but excellent timing on his part, as well
Anyone got a mirror?
Pretty sure that at one point during the filming of the fight scenes Harrison Ford screamed at Ryan something among the lines of "Punch me as a man, not as an actor"
If he was a woman, he WOULD remember
lmao this reminds me of when Dane Dehaan had an anonymous AMA on 4chan and said "Harrison Ford I'm pretty sure is a high functioning autistic."
I have never watched "The GNS" but every clip I have seen is good. Always seems to have top-notched guests. 
His interviews make a lot more sense when you realize he smokes weed on the way to all of these publicity engagements. He is known to love the ganj
Yeah, it‚Äôs a joke, but he is still getting really slow
The uploaded has made this video not available in your country. Awesome! 
FTFY "Harrison Ford gets drunk on The Graham Norton Show"
Harrison Ford has no more fucks to give 
Clearly Ford is confused because he was thinking about Jared Goff and then they come with this guy.
More interesting than that segement is the recommended next scene where Margot Robbie tattoos a crew members toe. 
I forget Ryan Gosling's name too, for some reason every time I see his face my brain says 'Jake Gyllenhaal'.
Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford are national treasures. We must not lose them.
Harrison's got the best sense on comedy
It's a bit. 
His timing was brilliant throughout the whole interview , he should do comedy 
"as i reddit" :D:D:D:D:D
I'm going out on a limb here but I'm gonna say he's acting. Very obviously acting. For fun. To promote the film.
It looks a little staged to me
Wow, damn he's gotten old. Hard to believe he was Indiana Jones in my lifetime. 
Do you know how excited I'd be if Harrison Ford even attempted to remember my name?
I think it's pretty funny... eventhought I saw them pull the same Bryan Gosling joke in the german Pressconference and in a spanish Show.It seems both of them had their fun!
I forget names all the time, it‚Äôs an age thing. It‚Äôs why I call everyone ‚Äúdude‚Äù
I suspect Ford, Kevin Bacon, and Stallone were forced out of retirement by Bernie Madoff. Maybe others as well. 
Actually, this makes me a little sad. There have been quite a few reports about how Harrison Ford has been making some really serious pilot errors with his plane and that his wife has actually requested he not fly the plane anymore. And all of this because there seems to be some evidence that he is having really significant memory issues. And while he may be really gifted at improvisation, and timing that doesn't mean that he isn't trying to fake it. Personally I do think that he has some serious cognition issues that are not obvious and he's very gifted at covering it.  
Good for him
He has a great sense of humour. 
Harrison is hilarious the whole episode. It's a must watch. 
Reese Witherspoon is a doll. She looks better as she ages.
Harrison Ford is one of those celebrities I just don‚Äôt want to see die. The man is a legend. One of my favorite actors.
Hey, it happens when you get old. The Graham Norton Show is hilarious though. I like how they bring everyone out and let them interact and be natural. 
Because the episodes are so mixed up.
Brian Coughlin 
This whole episode is must watch for Harrison or Gosling fans, their comedy chemistry is phenomenal.
he's turning into leslie nielson
That was awesome. I think he could spend the rest of his career doing comedies. 
I really want a comedy with these two.
Well I, too, tend to forget the name of Randy Godwin sometimes.
We need Harrison Ford in *Naked Gun 4*, now!
There's a joke to be made, but I can't make it. Internet, I choose you:
I feel like I remember him doing the same about Josh Hartnett back on Leno or Letterman when he was promoting Hollywood Homicide. I also distinctly remember him making fun of the name of that submarine movie he did, K-19: The Widowmaker. 
Good thing he doesn't fly planes 
Worked shoot. 
Some ppl r born entertainers 
We get old. If we're lucky.
Is he high possibly? 
Can we start making it a rule that the links we post on reddit are no geolocked!
Reminds me of [this awesome clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB0wzy-xbwM) with David Blaine. Also how the fuck did he do that?
Harrison channeling his best Leslie Nielsen there..
He seems generally exhausted
I love Ryan in everything, even the band he made. But for some reason I alwaysss forget his name. There must be more to this haha
Harrison Ford is [pretty much constantly high.](https://youtu.be/yvW6SF-3CS8) 
Fake news 
If you're gonna get 'Harrison Ford'd on TV, there's no one better to do that to you than Harrison Ford!
I reddit. Did this catch anyone else off guard? 
Stop making baby Jesus cry. He's had a drink; forgot his name for split second, and then make a joke of it. 
These two guys together form the driest duo of humour ever and I LOVE it. 
More alcohol, and pot.Earring every day!
it's a bit.
I envy him.
Acting.
Neither can I.
Why has the uploader not made this available to watch in Australia? I‚Äôm outraged 
I would be laughing if this video wasn't blocked in Australia. Thanks for starting this trend SNL.
He's not important enough to remember. Ford rocks üèÜ
"So how you getting home Byran? I have a Cessner outside.."
I saw him on Jimi Fallon's show, and it was really funny.He crushed Fallon!
This part from the full episode is hilarious https://youtu.be/vH1zJVD7oNE?t=26m25s
The Baby Goose-guy.
Ford is like Colbert used to be, always in character.
Now that's what I call dementia.But I guess you couldn't remember lines anymore so who knows.
What‚Äôs in that glass??
So is Ryan Gosling's father Mr. Goose?
Watched this interview last night and didn‚Äôt realise how genuinely funny he is. Such a dry sense of humour, had me in stitches.
They make such a funny pair.
Harrison trolled you
Coolest person to ever live. 
Steven Toast is that you?
I love that Ford is doing more media/public appearances now. He's really funny and entertaining. 
This reads like a bit the two have done before to me.
its a joke they've been doing it alot in interviews now for a while... dont be shallow and watch other blade runner interviews.
Two of my favorite actors! 
I was always a fan of the Indiana Jones series with Harrison Ford. I feel like people may tend to think "Han Solo" too often. Funny dude and good actor, sad to see him getting old. He will be missed. 
Alzheimer is no laughing matter!
It was clearly planned.  Gimme a break. 
I can never remember his name and don't think I've ever seen anything he's been in. For the first 2-3 years of his career I thought he was the actor that played Phobe's brother in Friends. I was like, damn, that guy's career really revived, didn't it?True story, last time I was walking into bar trivia I googled him so I could name him if I had to. He didn't come up, however.
hmmm, thats a beautiful group of people gathered, except norton of course 
Master yoda: Forget not that what you have learned..to forgot
And? 
the "old age" effect starting to attack him.
Wonder why Ford feels need to put to put down Gosling in that oh so not subtle way!
Seems he can hardly talk without lines. Dude is pretty old. 
There's about a dozen or so "major" male stars about the same age with a scruffy look. Can't blame Harrison at all.
I don't like Harrison Ford
That host is gross
This is something I never knew I really wanted to see.
This is amazing. I love how the cat's front and back ends just start going independently because it just doesn't know what to do.
I want to get off Mr Bones Wild Ride. 
This was the demo for that Jamiraquia video. 
60 seconds later....Cat:   *Jumps off the table onto the carpet*Cat:   *HOOOORKa HRROOOOORKa...  HRRROOOOOOOORKA.......*Cat:  *HRRAAAAAAAAAACKT!!!*Cat:  *looks at the hoark with disgust and then walks away in a huff*
I can't stop watching
"Could you stop the table, please? I'd like to get off."
You spin me right round baby right round like a record baby right round round round.
I'm desperately curious about where the cat was trying to go.   Was it planning on lying on that paperwork?  It looked like it had a serious goal in mind.   I'd love to see the aftermath when the cat finally gets off the lazy Susan. 
I really want that table.
Cat fitness? This cat is really amazing.
This is the best physics lesson ever. 
If you squint and pretend the table's not moving, it looks like the cat is doing some sick roller skating. 
Something something get me off this crazy thing.
Fucks that‚Äôs funny. I watched it for too long!

Hamster wheel for cats, hours of confusion for your favorite pet !
If this were to be the only content on a 24 hour channel/stream.. I'd watch for days.

I feel frustrated for him 
I can't imagine this table being designed for any other use. 
Some say that cat is still out there, spinning.

Zelda thicc.
Link banged zelda. Fuck
I really would like at least one mainline Zelda game at some point in the future to actually establish a significant relationship for Link and Zelda that isn't just "two souls fated to reincarnate together forever." I don't know what Nintendo's stance on actual love between main characters is though
The "and this is what their kid could look like" fanart is my favorite kind of fanart.
This is so cute, melts my shipping heart <3 
Link kinda looks like a Fire Emblem character. I like it
This makes me so happy inside!!
Brings me back to my teenage years when I was a weaboo. Zelda's dress reminds me of Usagi and then the little girl is like Chibiusa/Renee, both from Sailor Moon. Link doesn't look like Tuxedo Mask though.
The question is, what's her name?
I still think the best romance was link and Marin in links awakening. That beach scene.
Baby zelda :3
Agree
I feel like link should be shorter. 
Spirit Mipha is going to be pissed if she finds out Link knocked up the girl he's been  telling her not to worry about. 
Holy shit. This is terrifying. 
They better hide the Nebuchadnezzar!!!

THIS GUY KITES
Does anyone know where I can buy one of these? 
Saw those a few years ago and was like, "I want one!" --Then I saw the price... fuck that shit.
This totally kites! 
where to buy these!
The invasion has begun!
Oh man someone should so whip this out on someone on acid 
ITT: People not understanding that not all Redditors speak English as their first language. 
These look so much like the jellyfish puppets they use in Broadway‚Äôs Little Mermaid!
Spawn more overlords.
It reminds me of those aliens from the Metal Slug game series
Its the Ceph.
Nice try Martians, these no kites.
The Octopus Overlords have arrived. 
I want one. STFU and take my money!
Anybody else think of H.P. Lovecraft?
Someone do this in the Netherlands and watch the potheads go nuts at the alien invasion. 
I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going

All the tangled strings... They're so close.
Your service to the overlords is appreciated!
No thank you!
Nope
If you had a good enough drone.. then attach the kites and fly it over a city
Oh look! My worst nightmare!
Ohhhhhhhh boy when those things get tangled. What a catastrophe. 
I'd hate to untangle these when they collide
Alright... Who played From Beyond
Just happening upon this event on the wrong psychedelic could prove mind shattering.
It's all fun and games until someone tangles with someone else's kite
I noped out of there pretty quickly.
Solid Firestrike score.
This is how they filmed the matrix sentinels
Is this proof that we aren't in a simulation?
Oh Helllll no
where can i get this someone HELP

I read kites as kitties and really had to stare at this for a while before I figured out where I'd gone wrong.

Where can one buy something like these? 
how do i get one?
All hail the flying spaghetti monster 
What is dead may never die.
SPAWN MORE OVERL-nevermind this is enough
I want to trip on acid there
This makes me really uncomfortable 
Does it look like flying octopuses, or does it make everything else look underwater?
Is it just implied that if there are clouds like the ones pictured in the gif, it'll be great weather for kite flying? Aka just windy? 
This could be a Bloodborne movie.
This is fuckin awesome! I wonder you can buy these
"tentacles all over the place".........( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) 
Where can I buy one of these!
Take the red or the blue pill? 
I get a Salvador Dali vibe when I crop it to only see the kites 
They look like reavers from GOW
Now to me that looks like aliens

Ia ia, Cthulu fthagan 
This is nightmare fuel for sure.
which kites are these specifically.?so scary
I'd love some dementors, however they're spelt. The things from Harry Potter. 
That's the stuff nightmares are made of. 
Any idea where I can get me one? I want to slather it in glow-in-the-dark paint and fly it around town on stormy nights.
This is actually kind of terrifying -also reminds me of the way the dementors float in Harry Potter, anyone else see it?
Imagine being high on acid/LSD/mushrooms and seeing this shit. 
I knew it. This is the Matrix and always has been. Damnit.
Nah nope 
Fuck! Now there's sky spiders too?!?
This kites is holy wow.
[Insert shameless plug for own kite store here]These are so common, though. Everyone and their mothers buy an Octopus, I much prefer my Astronaut kites :DLove to see ones that aren't common, like Bruce Flora's Toothless kite. He brought it to New Smyrna a couple years ago and it was spectacular. If you like kites like this, DEFINITELY consider seeking out kite festivals around your area. Tons of fun, almost always free admission, and spectacular kites of all kinds.
Cthulus minions!
THIS KITES
Who needs computer effects when you have kites.
Some Japanese girl is going to have one hell of a day.

‚ÄúCould be a millionaire within five years‚ÄùReport that. I used to work in Marketing Compliance and MLMs are the worse. 
"Multi-level marketing", is this how they call pyramid schemes now? 
"How long have you been with the company""3 years""So you're about a half millionaire by now, right?"
"Now if you'll just take a look at a picture of this triangle...."
Wow. Just incredible.
I met a guy at the market he was genuinely nice and asked for my email for networking reasons. I have it to him not thinking much about it. We emailed back and forth for a few days about jobs in the area and places to go out.One afternoon he asks for my number so I gave it to him. He then calls me about an "investment" opportunity he was "brought into" with some executives over a game of golf. He said "these guys move fast and I need to know if you are in asap" and then I replied by saying "thanks but no thanks. Not a good time for me to be investing" He replied with a firm "ok" and hangs up. I have lost almost all hope in humanity and meeting people out and about. 
But It Works!
Ya'll. I fell hook, line & sinker for that shit about three years ago.I'm now a millionaire. As in, millions of fucking angry moments.I was overweight  (I still am, too... Whatever) and perusing the weight loss tag on Instagram and found a girl who "changed her life" with beachbody products. She had the before and after to prove it, too.I bought 21 day fix and a bag of shakeology. Shakeology, if you have never had it, is like satan ground up chalk and maalox and a few dashes of hatred for you to have for breakfast. But if I didn't drink it, I just wouldn't get results!!So I spent my first $160. I did the stupid challenge group. It worked.I lost like 30 pounds and was thinking I was kickass so I wanted to try the newest insanity max 30. But my coach thought with my weight loss I could motivate others to "change their lives" and I thought.... Hell yeah!I fucking went nuts. I was posting about beachbody and shakeology non stop. I hated the damn shakes but you HAVE to buy them to "level up" as a coach and I knew if I just followed my coach's advice I would be financially free soon enough.Yeah, about that. My coach was pressing me to get emerald status. That's where the real money starts! It's soooooo easy! Find one friend to sign up as a coach and then just sign up your husband! So easy!Oh. Being emerald means your coaches HAVE to buy shakeology for you to remain at that level.So I was buying shakeology for myself. And for my husband who was never going to drink it ever. Now my household is spending close to $300 a month for me to find financial freedom through beachbody. I did make a few sales during my first week because a few friends and family members bought, after seeing my weight loss. So you feel motivated and successful because you are selling and "coaching". No. Within three months, I dreaded working out. I HAD to work out and drink shakeology to be a good coach, that's what they kept telling me. I was tired. Physically and emotionally. I ended up getting much worse in my already established eating disorder  (bulimia) to the point the only thing I was not purging were the shakes. My pulse was 38. I was in bad shape but kept going. Just keep going just keep going. They didn't want ME to succeed. Just to keep buying the stuff so they could get paid. I ended up in the hospital for almost three months. First in a regular hospital for my heart and then to a specialized hospital for eating disorder treatment then to residential care and then to php. The whole time my coach was begging me to come back to beach body that I could use my "recovery" to connect with people. I eventually had to block her and probably 50 other girls from instagram and fb and texting/calling.It took me over a year to fully recover my health after all that and I'm happy to say I'm in recovery from eating disorder behaviors too. But beachbody destroyed my life and my health and my "coaching" a twenty something stay at home mom without any formal education was encouraging me to let this take over and ruin me for her own financial gain. MLM's aren't bad necessarily because of the product but because they promote this environment of women supporting women and being one big family to lure you in and then you are left to the wolves.Tldr- I drank the beachbody kool-aid and it ruined my life.
I'm a sap. Whenever one of them comes up to me i think "Oh sweet, a random nice person who notices the effort I put into my 200 dollar tattoo" and 60 seconds later am desperately finding a reason to leave the nut section of Fred Meyersedit* (the reason i say this is because the last one who approached me used the tattoo as a conversation piece.)
My oldest friend and I have a very stained relationship right now because of her MLM. In one Facebook post she'll be trying to recruit new members by telling them she makes $250 an hour, but in the next three she'll be bitching about how she can't even afford to replace the windshield in her 15 year old car.When I finally had enough and called her out on it, I was attacked by her and her MLM cronies for being unsupportive. 
Think this is why I didn't get hired at Aerotek  10 years ago 
"And you can be sure it's not a pyramid scheme, because we redid the graphic so it's not a pyramid."

"Your request is not unlike your lower intestine: stinky, and loaded with danger"
Ugh.  Trying to find a legitimate job in marketing or advertising. At least, a third of the posted jobs are MLM schemes. They're getting so bad now that people who worked at one MLM are now opening their own MLMs and referencing the other ones. You're all crap. Nobody wants to sell your baseball tickets, bus tours, or shitty tourist trap events. 
Life pro-tip.  If a company makes more money off it's employees than actual customers... the employees are the customers.
Yeah I got roped into an interview for one of these jobs a couple of months ago. They advertised it as a training position but it wasn't until I got in the interview that they let me know that you have to start on the bottom rung before you get to train. BUT I could be a manager of my own firm after a year of being a door to door salesman. 
I used to go to recruitment meetings every once in a while. I was broke and they ALWAYS had free food/additional free stuff. It was shocking to see people buy into that stuff. Totally worth sitting through their bullshit presentation so I could smash a bunch of free food.
Need some h's in that "really".

"Pharoah" in 5 years.   They are fucking pyramid schemes. Imagine my face when my retarded high school friend of 20 years tries to recruit me for one of the pyramid schemes he fell victim to every 2 weeks. A different one, I don't know how he finds different ones. And they are all full of bullshit:"Super miracle drink made of extracts blueberry, raspberry... (count all berries and fish oils).. that revitalises.. bla bla"   "How about I just eat the berries? "   "Uh... yeah.. could be difficult to find.. "   "Nah they are sold around the year at the grocery store accross the street."    "We could give you a presentation at starbucks for 30 minutes? "  I mean you could be dumb, that's ok. But assuming other people will also be dumb and invest their non-existent savings into being scammed..

Ahhhh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haa ha ha haaaaaaalrighty theeennnn . . . 
If you're ever torn about whether you believe a business is a MLM or not, ask yourself: Are you really your own boss when you're still working for someone else? I know people who are their own boss, and there's no comparison to someone in a MLM, who own nothing about their business, and their own success is based largely upon finding people to work under them. It's less raising themselves up by their bootstraps and more like putting others under heel.Would you want the manager of a restaurant to be someone who was promoted for their business savvy, knowledge of the workplace, and ability to command; or some social busybee who found and hired 4-12 people to do their job for them?The reason they don't run ads or cold calls is not because they don't need it, it's because they want to avoid as much public scrutiny as possible, as people realizing they don't want to work for them is a direct assault upon their bottom line, moreso than any other kind of business. And Forbes, like the IRS, doesn't really care how you came about your money, but rather that you have a lot of it, and may continue to have more of it in the future without breaking any specific laws. Not paying employees a salary means there's no overhead, and everyone being "self made" means that they can be isolated when they fail- "the MLM isn't a bad idea, this person just wasn't cut out for it. Look at all these successful people taken from a pool of the 15-30% success rate?"Find a real job, that sucks, and won't make you a millionaire, but does pay a steady wage. Take their stolen words about hard work and dedication, and following your dreams, and apply them to yourself! All the things that are "easy" are worthless and a waste of your time, and all the things that are worth something take time and effort to grow, and you are worth something. If it's possible to become a millionaire in five years, mopping bathrooms is as good a start as any, as long as you're investing wisely in yourself. And most of the people that live out their dreams and follow their happiness do fine on $80k anyway.

So this is just like an obama healthcare plan? Theoretical and for imbeciles.
everything's a pyramid scheme really. primerica is good, you might not become a millionaire but you can make a decent living and 100k a year isn't out of reach.
MLMs aren't that bad if you work with the right company and with the right people. Amway was awesome but it's no get rich quick scheme.

http://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/health/canadian-woman-warns-others-after-botched-eye-tattoo-1.3610603#_gus&_gucid=&_gup=twitter&_gsc=4ISyiNU A lil harsh I think. Yeah I would go anywhere NEAR body mods this crazy, but apparently the mistake was with the tattoo artist who uses the wrong size needle and punched her eye wayyy too deep. Basically the "tattoo" just comprised of a tiny bit of purple in that's supposed to cover the white of her eye and make most of her eyeball look purple. It's kind of a dumb gamble to make, but still, it's something that's been done [properly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleral_tattooing) in the past so it's not *100%* her fault, like 90% probably

I'm too scared to get Lasix let alone a tattoo.
The good news is her new, glass eye can look exactly how she wanted her real eye to look.
She turned a blind eye to the dangers involved.

I've seen this done on some people and it looks pretty cool. Look up Grace Neutral and you'll see her eyes are tattooed like this. I mean it's a lil harsh to be wishing for her to lose an eye. Yeah she fucked up and should have gone to somebody who specializes in these types of body mods and not some hack.
The tatoo artist should be held accountable as well 
Makes me think of Issa in the Hella Blows episode.
Holy shit that made my own eyes start to tear up omg
In a week she'll been warning us about her other eyeball, which recently recieved a piercing.
On one hand the boyfriend is a piece of work. On the other hand this stupid girl let an unlicensed idiot inject dye into her eyeball...At some point personal responsibility becomes a thing.Didn't she ever get the "If X tells you to jump off a building, would you?", speach?
X post to r/RVA please? 
Well... She's a dumbass. 
That NES tattoo fits....she played herself.Edited: NES
I'd rather stick a needle in my eye... Oh wait. 
Why does her eye look like she has a rinnegan
On a episode of locked up they had a guy who had both eyes red. I am pretty sure he did it in prison with pen ink. 
This guy just saw all these threads on reddit and just uploaded his own twitter reaction to reddit.
Alright, most of you are here for the eye stuff, but his username and account are Kacchan and AttackOnTiddy, two anime references. I don't really know where to go from here, but I'm proud I noticed
"It'll look cool" they said.....
So I'm in the body mod community and I've got one good rule for shit like this: "Could this impair your ability to work or cause irreparable damage to your body?"If so, don't fucking do it. In any form... This is still experimental and long term results have not been seen... So sticking that shit in your eye and 5 years down the line maybe going blind because the ink migrates or deteriorates your eye is just not fucking work looking "unique". You can cover up tattoos and get laser, you can remove piercing, I can go on living a normal life with fucked up taste buds if my tongue split goes wrong... I'd be hard pressed doing much of anything if I went blind.I've got nothing but resentment for people like this because they actually make our life more complicated in the industry.Fuck that girl.
Apparently there is a way to do this correctly. [Meet Pauly Unstoppable](http://68.media.tumblr.com/be2a9de5ceb3650baecf8b2b6bf8bd06/tumblr_mgl3bvjDmO1rgxg4zo1_500.jpg). 
I think I appreciate his Twitter handle the most.
Sasuke has been using his Mangekyo too much.
This is what happens when a fool gets together with a sham of an artist. In skilled, legitimate hands this body mod still carries risks but is becoming pretty reliable. It's an extreme mod though, not for the faint of heart or inexperienced. 
My son has a degenerative eye disease and we've spent thousands of dollars and many years trying to save his sight. People who throw their eyesight away like this by doing something so stupid drive me crazy
I didnt do lasik for years despite the fact that it was being done by a man with a million dollars worth of education 20 years of experience and a multi-million dollar machine and this idiot thinks its smart to get her eye fiddled with by a high school drop out in a dirty strip mall.
Good title
Come on now lady
Eye can't believe she did this
Does she cry purple now?
Shit, why is no one recognizing this title üëÄüëÄüëÄ
SMORT
Sometimes some people need to be reminded not to get face tattoos though...
Why are these a thing even?
Play stupid games win stupid prizes
If at first you fail, try try try again!
Hello /r/rva
Hmm let's tattoo my eye - yeah fucking right... 
All I can say is, "Thanks Tips!"
What a moron. 
Now she can get a tattoo on her glass eye 
This seems obvious, isn't it obvious?
She should have seen this coming
That's an unique case of pink eye.
I may need multiple warnings (I'm a little slow and forgetful sometimes)
hey, i only will ever have 2 of these, theyre irreplaceable, lets experiment on one of them
Remindme! 1 year
Eye matey, who could üëÄeyeüëÄ guess this thread would turn into a thread full of eye puns. Eye eye üëÄüëÄ
But. But. Thinking! 
If I can't say the n-word, why can a non-mentally challenged person call someone retarded? 
What does this have to do with BPT?
I might be willing to do something with my Sclerae if it's reliably safe.
I can't even put eye drops in, much less even think about getting an eyeball tattoo.She went full retard.
Ha! I said the same about face tattoos way back when.
Cross my heart and hope to die...
This sounds like a r/FloridaMan story
I can't judge, I've made a few mistakes in my youth. I bought a pair of white Levi's in 1995.
What‚Äôs with these cases of rampant absence of normal commonsense of all involved people? How can it be that they are happening every so often?!
I've made a terrible, terrible mistake...  Better call the local news to tell people about it. 
what a dumb bitch
"Hindsight is always 10/20"-her probably
she must be on meth dude
Charlemagne Tha God gave her donkey of the day today
Is this going to end up being one of those "Police suspect drugs were involved..." stories?
eye eye captain
She will probably get a dope eye patch though
Natural selection at its finest 
RemindMe! 6 Months "Look up Catt Gallinger's boyfriend sentencing"
Savage but true
oh good i was highly considering sticking a needle in my eye instead of just getting custom contacts ...glad she cleared that up for me 
and thats why you go to licensed and not cheap artists.
That's not fair to people who are mentally challenged 
Bright side, she can get whatever the tattoo was and copy it onto her new eye patch.
Game Over Man (cuz chest piece)
Uh duhhhhh
guess she didn't see that coming
Lol u hear that guys she's warning us not to get a tattoo on your eye because it turns out it's dangerous thank god she was brave enough to do what we were all thinking because if it weren't for her who knows how many ppl would've gotten blind from that she is truly a saint an a godsend....LMFAO üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Don't put ink in you're eye she definitely won a being retarded 
"http://lunacobra.net/services/" if you are interested. 
What a dumbass white ho lmao
Or, you know, wear contacts instead
Stupid is as stupid does 
What people are forgetting is that she would have gotten heaps of likes on Instagram if it worked.
Title is **L I T**
The lack of punctuation makes me think he's at least mildly retarded. 
Honestly, how can that even be a good thought.
1. Im sorry but i cant really feel any sympathy for her.2. Who is the fucking criminal who did the procedure? 
I got heavily downvoted once for saying that eye tattoos are a step too far and disgusting. I stand by that.
I work in a pretty high end body modification studio and even me and my work rat's think this is crazy! 1) no diluted ink was even thought of being used...2) THERE HAS BEEN ONLY ONE PERSON IN HISTORY THAT HAS SUCCESSFULLY DONE THIS MORE THAN 3 TIMES AND EVEN THEY'RE LIKE NUH FUCK THIS 
/r/iamverysmart /s
I'd never understand people who'd tattoo some of the most sensitive spots on their body. 
I can't imagine the pain
Sooo... is she going to finish it?
Biiiiiiish
This is reason 846 on my 1000 reasons on why not to get an eye tattoo
Thinning the herd ...
I read that to my wife and she said "don't use the R word"
So woke to not have needles pushed into your eyes.  gj fam.
I feel like this would be a Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia episode.
My tattooist has this I think. Totally thought it was a special contact lense but now Im thinking otherwise.
How did she not see this coming? 
To be fair, done by someone who knows how to do an tattoo on an eye it is safe. Done by an amateur who has never done it before or does not know anything about it.. well you see what happens.
what an idiot
The takeaway...Don't fuck with your eyes.  Got it.
There are quite a few people that had this done with zero problems.  Stay away from the DIY home eyeball coloring kit.
This isnt a suoer uncommon body mod, and Ive seen it look pretty cool.  My guess is allergic reaction to the ink, since tearing purple. 
> Hello, Tout d'abord merci pour le soft et votre travail !Deux petites questions : 1.

On peut avoir une id√©e du montant ? :-)Le projet de montage vid√©o VLMC est abandonn√© ou en stand by ?Hello, first of all thanks for the software and your work!I have 2 questions : 1) In a video from VLC, you said you were proposed "an insane amount of money" to include sponsored content or some other filth in the software. Can we get an idea of how much? :-)2) Is VLMC video montage project abandonned or on stand-by?The Answer> 1) de l'ordre de plusieurs dizaines de millions de ‚Ç¨. 2) √ßa avance encore :)1) In the ordrer of several tens of millions of ‚Ç¨.2) Still working on it.
[This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/736ghk/ama_je_suis_le_pr%C3%A9sident_de_videolan_et_le/dno97w4/) explains why it's a traffic cone the icon of VLC. I'm too lazy to translate, but in short: Students, Alcohol and lack of sleep.
Well, that's me.However, I am not the VLC creator, since there is no creator to VLC. But I am managing the project since 10+ years, and I created the non-profit VideoLAN.Hope you enjoy it. ;)
What a clever way of pursuading me to make a [donation](https://www.videolan.org/thank_you.html). Come on reddit, let this man have his millions!
[Translation](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/736zm2/slug/dno570o) from /r/linux.
Someone want to translate this for us?
It was 20 M ‚Ç¨, just to add some bloatware to the installer
I would sell my soul for a few milions.
Reality: The creator may incorporate ads, but if he did so most other devs would fork the codebase and continue with an ad-free version.
That right there, boys and girls, is dedication! VLC is by far (IMHO) the best media player out there. I've been using it for years on my personal computer and just recently also on my Android OS phone. 
Going to have to donate some cash ...
Le respect
What a fucking nice guy 
Your post is totally ambiguous, and could equally mean two opposing things. Is he saintly or greedy? Cannot tell
Donated 5 bucks right now.You can do it basically with 1 click here. https://www.videolan.org/It is the best video player out there. 
Put some non intrusive ads in VLC and then let the user decide if he wants it enabled or disabled.
[Google translated page](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnp.reddit.com%2Fr%2Ffrance%2Fcomments%2F736ghk%2Fama_je_suis_le_pr%25C3%25A9sident_de_videolan_et_le%2Fdnnyrop%2F&edit-text=&act=url) until a proper translation comes through.
This is in french.
well guess he knew how many of us would use another player in a heartbeat if he had.
Winamp audio | VLC video
Wait, what?https://np.reddit.com/r/france/comments/736ghk/ama_je_suis_le_pr%C3%A9sident_de_videolan_et_le/dnpcw8c/
Couldn't he have just put one small ad and made millions instead? It's free and I use it all the time. 
Well, here i go to donate to the media player ive used for the last 6 or so years and never thought twice about because of how intuitive and feature-packed it is
The title made me think that he refused money just so that he could have advertisements allowed still
If vlc had adds i would stop using it and would use media player classic.
VLC is fucking amazing. I use it almost every day, and I can even watch region 1 DVDs on it in Europe!!!
Keeping it real. Props to the VLC team.
Oh, what a misleading headline.
Fuck it, I‚Äôd sell the project for that. Then when there‚Äôs ads put in it I can distance myself.20mil is a crazy amount of money.
Some heroes don't wear capes
How do they make money then
Props to the guy.Though I'm a selfish scumbag and I would do the same. He doesn't need more money - he has enough. Smearing reputation for excess money just isn't worth it. :P
Honestly, if there were ads most people would probably swap to another video player and vlc would die so that was a smart move
Ads are the scum of the earth.
I am glad. However if they had a side business to cash in, I'd feel better. Hard work deserves money and my praise doesn't pay the bills.
You only live once. After the beautiful work you put in. Swim in the fruits of your labor. There is no shame. Structure it in such a way to make sure you are not forgotten. 
This is an open source software, so if main developer spoil it, there will be better fork. For example read about mplayer or openoffice
Made my donation to VLC... now that I think of it, I might donate to wikipedia too. 
VLC is based af, i dont know why anyone would use anything else, i dont (i do) know why microsoft and apple doesnt adopt something as efficient as the FREE program.
The only way to win over filthy lowly materialists is to value your ideals more than your life. That's how we will win. 
I think this is mistranslated. They refused money to put ads in the software. VLC is staying ad-free. 
Seems stupid to me.  If I was in the same position I'd take the money then create VLC Origin and do what I could to let everyone know that Origin was the better option now.
C'mon man just take the money
VLC needs MadVR support if it is to ever be taken seriously by the htpc crowd (or anyone who cares about the best video quality) 
I was planning to finish my Fallout collection and this miracle occurs. Thanks.
I suggest installing Fixt mod (Fixes only option if it's your first run)http://www.nma-fallout.com/threads/fallout-fixt-0-81alpha-july-5th-2015.194562/This community patch includes fixing bugs, restoring features, modifying balance, adding new features, and many fixes to text/dialog.
I wonder how many people are going to drop this after 30 minutes because of how different the gameplay is from the newer Fallout games.
Does it stay in your account after the 30th? These dates always confuse me whether it's free for a limited time or if it's just a free trial period.
Already own it it but at least my friends can get it
if it's your first time playing you should probably read the character creation section of [this guide](http://user.tninet.se/~jyg699a/fallout.html).
Thanks!
Well might as well grab my 4th copy I guess.Got one free copy on CD with some computer magazine years and years ago, when I bought Fallout 2 I got a free copy of Fallout included as well and a while ago I got it free on GoG and now this. Think I should be covered. Amazed they still sell it for as much as it's normally priced.
There are just good people in the world, trying to inform the masses. Thank you OP, it has been added to my library. 
An all-time classic, and a far better game than the 3-dimensional sequels if you can look past some of the 90's mechanical jankiness. Get it while it's hot folks.
Thanks, Jeans.
The game won't run on my PC? I hear audio but it's a black screen. I have an Rx480, do you think it's too new for this old game?
Just watched a speedrun earlier today. Now I'm gonna have to try it. 
Son of a bitch I bought this about a week ago! My timing in purchases are always terrible lol
I've never played any Fallout game and was thinking about where to start. Although it's obvious to start by the first title, is it a good game to get hooked on the series?
Whoa! Nice!Can we get Fallout 2 as well? :<
This is to save everyone:  1: Use multiple save files 2: Get rads before going to the glow 3: You can buy more water from the water merchants The end, make sure to download the fixt mod and youll be good
Play it. Play it. Play it. Play it. Play it.
Just a warning to people who haven't played classic fallout or other classic cRPGs, the mechanics are reaallllly dated. And in this game specifically, until you know what you are doing you are going to die over, and over, and over again at the very beginning of the game achieving nothing.There is no shame at all in following a build guide for your first playthrough
This is supposed to be Wastelands 2, but interplay bought the rights.... I am sure glad this is what happened...Wasteland 2 was kickstarted , and I finally got it..... Yeah. I am Glad Fallout happened. Wasteland 2 was a cool game and all, but far too complex for a younger generation back in 1990's. Give it a shot. It is what hooked me on the fallout series. It will give the newer fallout gamers an idea where VATS came from, and how revolutionary it was for any RPG at the time.The song by the "Dew drops" still haunts me after the intro. They added it back to the game in Fallout 4.
...and I just bought it last month...
Man, you have no idea how happy this makes me. This has been a great day already, and now this! 
Thanks OP!
Great find, thank you.
Awesome!
Thank you!
Yoink!
I was just looking to but this two days ago but ten bucks was to much for me. Thanks for posting this!
thank you for this, i would not have known
When you finally decide to buy it last week...
Is there a Mac version?
What sucks is the first couple games were always free on their website up until a few years ago.
Got it. Thanks OP.
This is what fallout is really about.Shits all over the 3d ones
Damn, just bought it last month.
SHIIIIT, I don't have access to a computer until October but i have the steam app, is there any way i could get it?
Still waiting to find friends to play online mod with me :/edit: actually i think thats for fo2
Nice! Glad I caught this as I'd been wanting to play the original for a while now. I feel that's the best place to start with the series. Thanks for the heads up OP!
Groovy, thanks!
is this fun
I've tried to get into this game 4 times now, but it just never seems to grab me. I've read the lore and understand how rich the world is, but I just can't get into it. I also tried Fallout 3 and couldn't get into that, so I don't think it's the isometric view and interface and more the fact that as much I want to enjoy it, post-apocalyptic games just don't do it for me. üò•
Fuck, I've never played a fallout game. I bought 3 GOTY during the steam summer sale AND just installed 1. Guess I know what I'll be doing now. 
Wow I was looking forward to picking up this game, as I was watching a lot of videos about it on YouTube and just got a new laptop which cannot play modern games all that well. What a coincidence! üòÄ
So, I know next to nothing about the Fallout series before 3. Any advice for a newcomer?
I just dreamt about playing this game, only to wake up and see this, thanks op
Thanks bethesda! 
Thanks for the heads-up!
OH BOY
Well I've never tried it,only played Fallout 3 and NV. That'll be a nice change of pace.
This is like your dealer giving you the first bag for free.  Then you come back for more and he says, "All I have right now is Fallout 2 for full price" and you suck his dick.
planning on getting into fallout series. what installment would you recommend to a newbie?
Will this even work on Windows 10?
grabbed, hoping to play over the weekend.
Do I keep it as free game in my Steam Library or it won't be free after the September 30?
fallout 4's better
this is my favourite Fallout, despite lacking in some areas it feels more focus and personal than Fallout 2.
Thanks for the heads up! This is a crafty way to end up making me want to buy and play FO2 again.
GODS I WAS A GOOD GAME THEN 
are there mods for this fallout game as well?
Sweet now I can simulate life after WW3
Big hint for new players: go for the eyes! 
for some reason, after I added this game, my steam profile says I have about 8 less games than what I did before
Is this just for a limited time or it‚Äôs ours to keep?
Linux?I've *played* this on Linux long ago - on a long haul flight it was one of the games. And the embedded system was Linux. So the game *exists* for Linux. So why no Linux version on Steam?Funny story - I enjoyed playing it for a few hours, saved my game and switched over to watch some TV, returned to it to find .. no SAVE GAMES. Whoever had ported it to the embedded in flight entertainment system apparently hadn't realised that this was the sort of game where save games might be important, even just for the duration of the 12 hour flight.GAH!
Nice I might give a shot :D I have tried fallout 3, 4 and new vegas
RemindMe! 7 hours
Thanks!
Anyone got the required specs for this bad boy? I want to make sure my Pentium 1 can handle it.
If I already got this through GoodOldGames is there any benefit getting it on steam as well or is it all the same?
Does anyone think remastered versions of the isometric games would be successful?
Got it.
Let's just remember something kiddies: before you bash them you need to thank Bethesda for this. They are the ones giving it away. Not Black Isle, not Interplay, not Brian Fargo or Josh Sawyer or Chris Avellone. Bethesda.Say it with me: Thank you Bethesda!
We get to keep it forever?
Remindme! 12 hours

PC Only :(Thanks anyway.
Ah nice. I refunded this a while back since I couldn't get into it. I'll have to try again 
Could never get very far in this game :(
...that time GOG gave away fallout, fallout 2, fallout tactics (or whatever they're called) all for free at the same time.I tried playing but it was like 1990s slow,... anyway of speeding up the movement without having to do something tricky?
Fat chance that'll work on windows 10 when Fallout 3 doesn't. 
Haha grandma used the 'wrong' emoji 
‚ÄúYou are valuable!‚ÄùInteresting compliment
You are #1 out of the 17 grandchildren I have. 
I have yet to receive one emoji from my grandmother.  
Your grandmother is an appraiser? Why are you valuable? How much are you worth? I need answers.
Fantastic. This is one of those moments you'll cherish forever, trust me.

Inb4 a million new threads asking how to play the game.
**PLEASE NOTE: It's only free for the next 24hrs!** So go go go!! If you don't want to play it now, just add it to your library for later!
I probably wouldn't have noticed this without you. Thank you very much! 
This should be pinned until it's not free
So when we get to the 40th year can we get FO2 for free?
I think it's the 20th anniversary, isn't it?  Well, that's a nice way to honor it.(\**grumbles*\* It's more than Valve ever did for Half-Life, at any rate).
[Here's the ultimate unofficial patch for F1.](http://www.nma-fallout.com/resources/fallout-fixt-full-all-fixes-and-mods.8/)
Will it stay in my library?
For anyone wondering:  It's a permanent thing.  First of all, it registers it and doesn't say "Free Weekend" or "__ hours remaining" and second, even if it did have a limit, you'd technically be able to play it, because the game doesn't have the Steam API.
I already owned it on GOG but it's nice to know that I've completed my steam collection.
Thanks! Pretty "rough" but amazing game
Well fuck me in the ass with a deathclaw! I bought the fallout classic franchies a month ago for $3.87 what a bad investment even thought the classic completely change my outlook on the fallout franchies after fallout 2. /s
I got it for free 5 years ago, from GOG. It included FO2, Tactics, all OST and manuals.
Whelp, I've got no excuse now. Time to finally play it. Watching videos about this game's mystique has me super interested. 
Alright so I found some raiders and died immediately this is a good start to the game.
Cmon I just bought it
Thanks much!!! You just saved me $11! It was actual in my wishlist - I was just waiting for it to go on sale, but wasn't expecting THAT good a sale.
OP, you should include this mod link as it's from NMA and it patches bugs/glitches in the game from my personal experience of it.http://www.nma-fallout.com/resources/fal...nd-mods.8/
Thank you!  I let my husband know and he went running to his computer!  Lol
I bought the game 2 weeks ago. I don't care, money still well spent! Edit: I mean 2 weeks ago, not days 
For someone on Macbook Pro, what should I download to be able to emulate it?
Look out, guys -- This game requires a Pentium 90 Mhz
This is amazing. So many people will get to see how it all started!
A fine addition to my collection! Thank you!
Finally got around to playing this and I‚Äôm loving it so far! The hype is real guys üòÑ
Are there mods for this? Asking seriously, like texture packs and such
Dammit, I just paid full price like a month ago :(
How does one play Fallout 1?
I feel bad for anyone who didn't get 1, 2, and Tactics free when GOG was giving them away a while back.
I wish there was a way to claim it on mobile so I could play it for free next time I get a PC.
Much obliged. I already have a GOG copy, but it's nice to have a backup.
Highly recommended for anyone with a x86/x64 tablet and commuting by train or bus. 
I already have a physical copy and a copy that I got for free off GOG.com, but I'll never turn down another legitimate way to get *Fallout* for free!
Literally every time I cave and buy a game...Fuck it.  1, 2 and tactics for like 15 bucks... not that bad.
/u/RosettaStoned6
Nice.
Thank you very much for this. 
Can i download it on a tablet? 
Heeelp me get this on my Mac ugh fml 
Sorry if this is a stupid question, but will this game run on a new iMac? Or is it only for older PCs? I really want to download the game.
For those who weren't aware the fixit mod has options to allow you to disable both timers in the game. Granted it does kinda destroy the whole point of the game, but it;s good for people who have played it before and want to take there time exploring.
[deleted]
Does anyone know if it would be possible to get it running on a phone?
Farking shaweeet!  Thanks for the post, I might have missed it otherwise.
Thanks man!
I'm not anywhere near my PC can I get it without downloading it?
aaaaaaaand that completes my collection!OP is A-OK by me
I still have my original big box and CD, and I have it on Steam like any self respecting Fallout fan but thanks anyways!
Thank you so much kind stranger.Now I'll finally play it!
Thank you. Amazing game that I never beat because my character sucked, now I have no choice but to finish the damn thing. 
Thanks man!!
I just finished my first playthrough, met the Master and, since I wanted to talk to him instead of just murdering them all, I went for a wash in FEV. Boo.
Getting an "Oops" error. Wrong cuntry?
Hey, I have not played this before, but is the time limit still in it? I know certain patches quasi-remove the limit (or just extend it as long as physically possible).Also would that [Fallout Fixt patch](http://www.nma-fallout.com/resources/fallout-fixt-full-all-fixes-and-mods.8/) allow me to alter the time limit?
I‚Äôm still hoping for an iOS release of fallout 1 and 2
TIL in next year it will be the 20th annivasry for Fallout 2 in same date.
!remindme 1 year(for fallout 2 20th annivarsy)
I was 11 when I first played Fallout.I had gone to a videogame store during a boxing day sale with my father. I had some money from Christmas and I wanted to buy Age of Empires II and the Conquerors expansion. It was on sale and I had some money left over so I went through a specials bin. I found a game called "Deathrap Dungeon". I wanted it because it was based on the "Fighting Fantasy" of the same name. For those not in the know "Fighting Fantasy" books were basically choose your own adventure stories with some D&D lite features (dice rolls, inventories, etc). Naively I left it in the bin to get my father assuming it would be back when I return moments later. But it was gone when I got back. I was a upset, but my Dad said "hey what about this" holding up a copy of Fallout. The T-51 power armor helmet on the cover. I conceded it looked "okay...I guess" and went home, AO2 and Fallout in hand.I had been previously playing Goldeneye on my N64. Installing Fallout on the family PC my friend/neighbour asked "why are you starting a new game when you having finish Goldeneye?" But instantly I was hooked. I played Fallout for weeks and then months. AoE2 went untouched (I would later play it a lot because it's freakin' awesome). I don't think my parent's appreciated how mature the content was as I bumbled my way through the Wasteland, screwing this bit up and making terrible character builds, getting frustrated and killing everyone, to restart and continue to bumble my way into finishing it.It was a defining moment in my gaming childhood. It's really great. It will play on tiny notebooks (revisiting Fallout 2 almost made me fail a bunch of exams in University). I would recommend to everyone to try it out.
German here with the heavily censored version. anyone know any patches or fixes so that I can play it as originally intended? :P
Wish they'd've given out all the classics for free like GOG did a few years back.
Honestly, to a new player, how has this game aged? Is it really even worth downloading without the nostalgia factor?
Just downloaded it, works great on Windows 10 (1703). The mouse controls are quite clunky, but the game was made in 1997, so...I did manage to find out how to move (kind if), how to fight (well, sort of), the inventory, how to use stimpaks (kind of).I died after about five minutes, though :-D It is really a different beast to the later 3D ones, that is for sure.
I have 1, 2, and Tactics on GOG and have never been able to really play more than the first hour.  They're just too complex for me and I lose to the easiest of enemies, which blows because I'd love to play them.
I was considering buying it a few weeks ago, thanks for the heads-up
Hell yes! It's only 600mb too, pretty cool!
Is there a difference between the Steam and GOG versions?
Not available on Mac üò≠
*SPRINTS TO TRAINER DOWNLOAD*
Wish there was a Mac port. Grrrrrr.
going to get it rn
Appreciate the note. Will (eventually) get to play it.
This is awesome!!!
Thanks for the heads up! I really appreciate it.
I literally just bought the game two games agoGoddammit
Are there any MODS that fix the horrendous controls?
Meh, I got if free on GOG years ago... along with free Fallout 2 and Fallout tactics. I thought everybody got it by then... 
Not free in Canada, apparently.
Yeet
Nice finally my Steam collection is complete! :D
Thanks for the heads up. I "bought" the game now.
Now I have a game to play without emptying the battery of my PC during class.
How do I spend days crafting my own personal house?
I would get it if it was podsible to porti to android without much hassle, it would be perfect for mobile
I can't believe I just got up and ran across the room for some garbage Sim style fallout game thinking it was a legit good game jeez 
GODS I WAS STRONG THEN
Ooh, now we have the Mad Baron. Looks like Lugos has been spreading the word about the Middle Finger power! Good fun as always my friend! 
Lacking Lugos, 5/7
That backflip into the bird is flawlessly executed
I'm sorry but did I just see the weavess' snatch when she fell over?Good lordedit: https://imgur.com/a/K6oUh
GoneWildBarron
So we have Lugos beat O'Dimm, baron beat the crones. What's next? Vesemir vs the wild hunt?
Hahahaha totally expected the throwing out the door. GGs
I got the bad ending for him :(
He looks like Gabe N with those glasses
lol. some good stuff 
Where's Madman?
what got me was that Faaxii sign towards the end 
I didn't understand what was going on, but I still laughed. Good work!
Never got this ending.
He reminds me of Robert Baratheon... Or Robert Baratheon reminds me of him?
Brilliant!
I haven't followed the complete saga but I have to say the  Professor's Shades is my favorite gear in the game and I thank you for continuing their story.
I'd watch that movie.
The world doesn‚Äôt need a hero, it needs a baron.
Where is Madman Lugos?
It's all in the reflexes
Ded xD
This is the best
What mods and computer specs do I need to make the game look THAT beautiful? The resolution and the details are overwhelming 
really wish he didnt kill himself im my playthrough :(
I can't stand the Baron, absolute monster
I'm more interested in the person that saw this skull without teeth and decided to carve in new teeth for itEdit: TFW you deserve to fail the elementary school spelling bee in your 20s
I'm sure that is more than two years old. 
It looks like his (her?) left eye was severely damaged while still alive.  Probably lived a tough life. 
This person had a name, a love, laughter and sadness. Their whole life lived, in pleasure and in pain, in excitement and in boredom.I wonder how old were they, when did they live, what did they see, what did they do, who are they....I stare at those eyes and missing teeth. If you stare hard enough, you can almost feel like they are looking back at you.....
I still cannot forget the video footage of the person that was lost in the catacombs. I cannot imagine a worse way to die.
Wow, I took this exact same photo in the catacombs in February 2016.Must be a charismatic skull!
I went to the Catacombs this summer, the line to get in was so long. After waiting 3 hours and not getting far I had to leave sadly.
[This girl from capuchin catacomb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalia_Lombardo) 
Looks like the skull of that homeless radio announcer guy.
Looks like the next "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie 
We‚Äôll all look like that one day 
I'm playing Assassin's Creed Unity, which takes place in 1790s Paris and the catacomb walls are filled with bones and skulls.    
üé∫
I think the 4chan post in the Catacombs was much spookier. 
Death is nothing but energy surrendered. It's always scary no matter how you go, but a little piece of you gets saved, maybe just a random conversation, but whatever this system we live in keeps those signals sent out.
The Paris catacombs are cool as shit. 
Pretty neat
Hail Sithis
I really want to go down there.One of my biggest dreams to explore part of that place on my own.
Took a picture of this same guy last night. Weird.
Man you were old 2 years ago.
Look Ma ! front page of reddit
Fake! Pierre looks nothing like that! Nice try!
Hard to believe this skeleton is only 2 years old!
Skulls aren't creepy.They're spooky, learn the difference.
That used to be a person.
Omg look how much it's been touched. 
everyones talking about the teeth for some reason, when what i want to know is why the right eye socket looks so mishapen
Did you get lost? Also this looks well crafted, but carved. The teeth kindof give it away.
Was there 3 days ago with my boyfriend. Bones are so much creepier when you know they're real.... and there's hundreds of thousands of them surrounding you
Took this pic while visiting last summer : https://www.flickr.com/photos/146595294@N05/34624707171So many skulls and bones, it's worth a visit if you ever find yourself in Paris.
Thanks to this picture, I've been reading about catacombs in Paris for the last hour. 
If I want to get a real human skull in order to make bitching necromancer staff for Halloween, umm, are they for sale on the internet? Bonus point if the deceased was some kind of cursed soul whilestill alive.
My old lady. She says she loves me tho 
This would be an awesome background if you have a higher resolution available 
Nah, it looks healed. Whatever caused the injury (and it was horrific) they survived it. 
I'm pretty sure they ask you to not take pictures.
What really freaks me out is that was a person at some point.  He/she had a whole life and things that they wanted or liked/disliked. Just like us. 
I have one of these sitting in my garage in a box.. how is a skull creepy? Not trying to be rude just genuinely confused here
It's pretty strange to thing that this was a living human being just like you and me 
... Its a skull.  How is that creepy
Nothing creepier than the catacombs in Paris from 2 years ago
"It looks like Woodstock, except everybody has their clothes on." -Mike Leach 2017
Such a Pac12AfterDark game. It ends after midnight for most of the country on a play that was in part a good play on the side of the winning team, and in part a fuck up on the part of the losing team.
In fairness to Darnold, he played as well as could be expected when he had to play with the entire broadcast crew hanging from his nut sack. 
ESPN can eat a cock for that shit coverage
chaos even before saturday feels soooooooo good
LEACH INTERVIEW RIGHT NOW "IT'S LIKE WOODSTOCK EXCEPT EVERYONE'S GOT THEIR CLOTHES ON" lol
THANK GOD I CAN FINALLY GO TO BEDTHANKS USC AND WSU FOR A GOOD GAME
Enjoy the fine for storming the field, it's worth every penny 
PASS ME A BUSCH AND PUT US ON THAT MOTHER FUCKING BANNER WOOO!
Don‚Äôt worry guys. Even though the game‚Äôs done Sam Darnold will find a way to win. He has the IT Factor.
Love me some pac 12 after dark!
*picked USC in the pick em**WSU wins*I'm not even mad
*Sam Darnold has been eliminated from Heisman contention*
ESPN: ‚ÄúDid you see the way Darnold took that loss? That was an NFL caliber way to take a loss. He is truly incredible.‚Äù 
Jamal Morrow is a problem. What a game.
I have nothing against USC. But I am glad they lost, simply because of the announcers.
Possibly the best game on Saturday began on Friday
Mike Leach seems legit disappointed that everyones clothes are still on. 
This means the chaos gods have been appeased for the weekend, right?.... right?
YOU CRAZY SONS OF BITCHES DID IT!!!!!APPLE CUP BEST CUP!
Can all college football announcers make a pact to stop licking Darnold's taint now?
THE FANS ARE ON THE FIELD
Think of all WSU's newly acquired land...
[Darnold's fumble that sealed USC's fate.](https://imgur.com/xtyqYbS)
Darnold looked... Mortal? But ESPN told me he was invincible? Did they... Lie?
Fuck it. Go cougs. 
Darnold actually won in the end by making himself look unattractive to the jets 
Darnold's anti-Heisman Moment confirmed
Mike Leach when asked about what it looks like on the field right now "It looks like Woodstock but everyone has their clothes on"
The fact that Darnold fumbled immediately on that two minute drill drive is incredibly satisfying given how much the announcers were hyping him up

Amazing game.  Pac 12 after dark lives up to the hype yet again.  
üçé Cup is about to be üî•
Don't let this USC loss distract you from the fact that BYU lost to Utah state tonight and their fans are bitter as a can of Coca Cola 
#DILLY DILLY
Inviting the Darnold is considered a great honor for an award committee. Heisman is hesitating, therefore acceptance is withdrawn!
Just imagine if WSU receivers could catch the ball
TONIGHT WE ARE ALL COUGS!!!!
I jizzed and it's not even my team.
"It's like Woodstock except everybody's got their clothes on"**Mike Leach is a national treasure**
HEY ESPN, AS LONG AS YOUR SUCKING IT, WHY DON'T YOU TELL US HOW BIG DARNOLD'S DICK IS
Am I alone in thinking Falk played his way into the conversation of top QBs tonight. He has some obvious flaws, but he's impressive.
Top ten Wazzu? Top ten Wazzu.
I'd love to stay classy in this post game post but it would be impossible to **hide this massive fucking Wazzu erection** tonight.    Go Cougs! Haven't seen awesome like this since 02 and 03!    Edit: Quick edit, hey COLLEGE GAME DAY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE ENJOYED THIS THANKS FOR MAKING IT A FRIDAY GAME ESPN
I'm really pissed that the first thing mentioned in post game is 'Darnolds Heisman hopes'....why the fuck are we not talking about Luke Falk's Heisman hopes? He's a better QB with better stats.......and literally just won the actual damn game
Welcome to the top 10 Cougs 
#DARNOLD FUCKING COUG'D IT

Hey guys! Did you know that USC is a 4th Quarter team??? 
holy shit 5 seconds in and this leach interview is gold already
I'm really ecstatic    :|\- Mike Leach
ESPN will now flip on USC and talk about how overrated they were. They will try and diminish this WSU win and use it as an excuse to try and exclude either UW or WSU from the playoff. Get ready, narrative is coming. 
Darnold didn't have any juice left for the comeback because the announcers sucked him dry. 
We didn't even get like thirty seconds of post-game celebration this is fucking bullshit. Fuck you ESPN nobody cares about your shit ass 1 AM SportsCenter broadcast.
ESPN>As expected, Friday night‚Äôs showdown between No. 5 USC and No. 16 Washington State featured a College Football Playoff contender and a Heisman Trophy candidate.>Not as expected: The Cougars are that team and their quarterback, Luke Falk, is that candidate.
IT FACTOR DENIED
[Hey Wazzu] (http://i.imgur.com/35bDxLp.gifv)  
Mike Leach is perfect for Pullman
You know what, win aside, this was legitimately a *great* game of football. If I had no affiliation i'd have been super happy to watch this game. 
Does Wazzu.....want Bama?
Today is a bad day for USC football...and therefore a great day for the world.
That was a pitiful performance by Darnold, and Wazzu took advantage really well. Good game Cougs.
ESPN bashing the pac 12....
Sorry to USC bros, but Wazzu is very easy to root for as a neutral party.  Heck of a win Cougars.  
really think this game exposed some weaknesses in USC coaching.  1) S&C coach... why so many injuries and cramps and stuff?!?2) the oline players should have been more ready to play.  i know some of them are freshmen or third string, but seriously...  they looked like they got no attention during camp.  3) nobody can get Darnold's head right.  he actually needs to get coached.  it's like clay is just riding on his talent and hoping to get bailed out.  coach the kid please.  4) no adjustments...  all game the same issues.  the D-lines confuses the o-line.  you can't make adjustments?  5) felt like USC coach's didn't watch any tape or something.  so many plays i've seen wazzu run and the defense wasn't prepared.  they check down and get a first down.  what is that crap.  6) The defense couldn't stop their O?  that's not because of the Oline.7) USC always had more talent on the field...
The last time both UW and WSU were in top 10 in the AP was week 10, 1997.  Let's fucking go!
Tonight, we are all cougars
Everyone expecting our fans to say that we are upset they won. Not even slightest bit true. It's great to see a highly anticipated Apple Cup. Also long as it ain't Oregon winning we happy. Screw them.
Who do the jets draft now

ESPN trying to write off the entire PAC-12 because of this game. Are you fucking serious? Get this bitch off my TV with your freezing cold fucking takes.
Pullman, WA now controls a mighty empire in the next CFB imperialism map. Everything that went wrong with USC over the past 4 games perfect stormed in Pullman and the cougs simply played better than us. 
H E A T E D B E N C H E SEATEDBENCHES
Unpopular opinion here (on a thread I'm assuming a lot of USC folks will see), but there's no way in hell Darnold goes first overall in the NFL Draft, and it's driving me crazy listening to announcers ramble on and on about him like he's the second coming of Jesus (if you watched the Cal/USC game, you know what I'm talking about). I don't know how ESPN's Adam Amin reconciles his fawning over Darnold's "accuracy, arm strength, and athleticism" with the throws Darnold was making all over the field. Of course Darnold has arm strength and athleticism, but so do a lot of players who never make it in the NFL. But he misfired on so many passes, it's absurd. So I thought, "maybe Amin doesn't know what NFL accuracy looks like" but that can't be the case, because you actually do have a QB on the field that *can* make NFL throws. Luke Falk has what it takes to be a QB in the NFL. Darnold, not so much. He'll get a shot from some team with historically bad QBs and/or historically bad team decision-making, just like Manziel did. Please, announcers, stop with the DARNOLD #1 nonsense-- it's the worst part about watching any USC game.And another thing, is it the same guy that keeps bringing that stupid fucking Jets/Darnold jersey to games? He has to know that it was an easy way to get on TV each game, because that's a stupid goddamn jersey and I hate your goddamn face.
LOL MODS @ THE BANNER
WE'RE GOING TO WIN THE SUPERBOWL
Congrats WSU! Rooting for you rest of season!
many thanks to WSU
PULLMAN TONIGHT IS GONNA BE WHAT THE KIDS CALL ‚ÄúLIT‚Äù
MY DICK HAS NEVER BEEN HARDER
Mods already on that banner change tho
We've gotta be pretty solid on the imperialism map this week
Is the "It factor" giving the ball to the other team a lot? 
Moment of silence for USC, and my liver 
We win the game and USC gets the top play of the night. Classic ESPN.
GG Cougs. Glad to watch this amazing game with such classy fans. Thanks for making my first trip to Pullman so much fun! ‚úå
Pullman is going crazy right now. 
If Heisman voting didn't take into account preseason hype, Sam Darnold wouldn't be top 500. 
As a USC fan, it really bothers me how consistently the announcers tempt fate by hyping up Sam Darnold. But I can't be mad, this was a great game and USC deserved to lose others this season. It was bound to happen.
Is leach always like that? He's so fucking chill.
Good game Wazzou. We were outplayed fair and square. Damn you and your pirate.
Just got back. So excited, best WSU win I've experienced yet
That was like Woodstock but for people with their clothes on.
I have no words....    That was awesome.

Well the imperialism map is going to really start to get interesting 
I picked USC in pickem because I knew if I did they would lose. Your welcome.
how do I sleep? seriously it's 3:20 in the morning and i'm still amped 
In the Boise State @ Washington State game thread there were Washington State fans calling for leach's job 
CHAOS HAS BEEN SATISFIED
Honestly.  What is the hype with Darnold. He had not even remotely impressed me this season. He looks at best like an average QB.  
IT FACTOR!PIE-R-IT FACTOR!
And Wazzu still won‚Äôt get a gameday. What a damn shame. 
/r/the_darnold about to go private
[Those announcers had a thing for Darnold](https://i.imgur.com/UMKXoFm.gif)
Leach is certainly somewhere on the Spectrum right?
We showed up in a prime time game. Fucking proud of this team
People usually say you shouldn't criticize or blame coaches because they're professionals and obviously know more than you. But I fail to see how I could've called a worse game than Tee Martin. He threw away a very winnable game and let a dangerous Wazzu team hang around for too long. 
Fuck it, go Cougs!
We are all cougs on this blessed day.
Listen.  I'm a UW fan and this is the best day of my recent memory.  
Pullman is a war zone

Leach is the ultimate poker player. Showing no emotion after the biggest win in 15 years 
Mike leach now has a .500 record at WSU after tonight's win. 
This game is so special the Seattle Times has some weird animation on their front page
Wazzu you better not fucking Coug it for the rest of the year.  Let's both keep winning and do this again in December so someone gets a playoff spot.  GG.
WE FUCKING DID IT WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Sam Darnold lost the game, but at least he got his dick sucked by the commentators.

Hahaha Mike Leach has some of the best one liners!"Coach, it seems kinda wild. how is it there?" "Well it's a lot like Woodstock only everybody has their clothes on."I love just hearing this guy say things.
In case you've been wondering Wazzu peeps, this outcome is because I have been in your state for work for the past week, drinking my brains out every night with Wazzu people.  And UW persons seem too fancy or cool or something to drink with me. You can thank me later.
FUCK THE DOUBTERS
PAC12 network still having tons of coverage, interviewing players, etc. Fuck ESPN
I now live in Coug Flag territory. Can't wait to see the map on Monday! 
It's about to get hot.I predicted this would happen weeks ago. Short week, Pacific Northwest, it had "Oregon State 2008" written all over it. The only difference is that Washington State is a legit top 15 team.Losing Juju and Darreus Rogers has really turned out to be a problem. Darnold has almost no chemistry with any of his receivers, and they've had 5 games now to establish that. If they can't establish the run (which they haven't effectively), the pass game isn't there to make up for it. If I see one more goddamn pass underthrown behind the receiver on an out pattern that leads to a pick I'm gonna fucking lose it.On top of that, the play calling has been questionable at best and downright atrocious at times. Look at the stats for the last 3 games, the conversion rate on late downs and amount of penalties was/is unsustainable. These are coaching problems. The hot take here would be this team is shaping up like the 2012 team that had all the hype in the world and failed on an institutional level.But wait, you say, SC hasn't been at full strength since week 2 because of all the injuries. Yeah well, for some fucking reason they don't even get a bye week to help heal. You can't even blame the defense for being a sieve, they managed to stop WSU and give the offense good field position with the help of some amateur hour punting, but couldn't collect themselves since the offense couldn't stay on the field. Which is hard to do when 3 out of 5 starting linemen are down, plus the #2 receiver who helps draw coverage away.What you've seen written here is the frustration of the last couple games, which have all weirdly felt like Ls in their own special way, coming out. We once again bought into our own hype and are seeing the first cracks in the armor showing. I'm not trying to take away from WSU, they are good and deserved to win that game. But the media and ranking system's refusal to tell the truth about USC set this up to seem like some world-changing event. In reality this SC team is flawed from top to bottom and only got more banged up tonight against a fundamentally superior opponent, regardless of "talent." Any USC fan who said they were confident about this game is liar. We've been through this too many times already.
Fuck playing it close we won the god damn football game against the University of Southern California. 
Sko Cougs!
GG. Friday night  @ WSU, it was always a loss.A lot of people are going to say that Darnold played bad... they are right.

I have done this before with a little squeaker like the kind you find in a dog toy -- it came as part of a toy from a cereal box freebie. I, in my infinite 8 year old wisdom, removed the squeaker so I could blow through it to annoy everyone. When I found out that I could make an even *more* annoying noise by *inhaling* through it...well, the inevitable happened. It lodged somewhere in my windpipe and when I coughed it made a dog toy squeak noise. This would have been hilarious to anyone who would have witnessed it but it was terrifying to me. I was very lucky - managed to hack it up after a round of violent coughing. 
I'm laughing...but this is shitty and I feel bad for the kid. Germans of reddit, give me a word that means this.

[He cant swallow a whole ball?](https://youtu.be/6NbgGhD4tdk?t=74)
Poor guy, he looks scared.
Not a doctor, and I don‚Äôt know how small science is making you whistles these days, but I‚Äôve inhaled a tiny 1x1 LEGO before and was in extraordinary discomfort. Rushed to the ER and fortunately coughed the damn thing up before surgery was necessary.My guess is that dad thought it would be funny to blow a whistle when the kid inhales and the kid looks like he thinks this is a stupid idea.
Inhaled, not swallowed.
[It has evolved.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS3jlUPPf5U)
Now he just needs to swallow a duck-call and he would make a great shooting partner!He could also double-up as a pulling partner on nights out as he has a party trick to get the conversation going......Until he gets the hiccups and screws the whole thing up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiBOLDxmCO8
This shit gave me anxiety
lmao he looks so sad hopefully he's all g now
How do you ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù swallow a whistle?!
I am suffering a facial cramp in order to not laugh my ass off and wake the missus 
Don't be sad little guy. People of Reddit will start a gofundme and you'll be rich in no time.
That was no accident. He was hangry as fuck.
Looks like a candidate for comedy magician! 
He's so adorably pudgy and soft. Poor kid, I just wanna put him in a bear hug
Reminds me of the Invader Zim when he swallows the moo toy.Edit: [this one](https://vimeo.com/18160138) 
yo this is the fucking ripping friends in real life
Toot toot just wants be a big strong elephant like you! 
He says "una vez m√°s," but he doesn't pronounce the final consonant sound in either "vez" or "m√°s."This dropping of the final "s" sound is a common feature of Central American Spanish.
That resigned face. The damn goofiness of the whistle. A meme has been born. 
SoFlo like Antonio
Why are kids so fucking stupid? My niece put a bead up her nose and it got stuck and she had to go the ER.
Now streamable is fucking autoplaying! Damnit reddit.....
I would be scared shitless if that was my kid
Is it not in his lungs if it whistles when he breaths?
Once for yes twice for no. 
"Dad, can we go to the hospital now? It hurts to breathe.""One more second, I gotta post this on reddit first."
What a hilariously life threatening predicament. 
It's that dog from Snatch... Check if he swallowed a giant diamond
More likely he ate a clown.
I'm dying here üòÇüòÇüòÇ
If not for his eyes, i would call this bullshit.
I hope he never gets this removed.EDIT: Yes, I get it, it's wildly unsafe and potentially fatal.  But if it weren't...
squidward irl
Shit I remember nearly chocking on one those things when I was a kid.
I see the dead inside look in those eyes. What ever nick name they've been calling him all day... his for life. 
He looks so sad 
One does not accidentally swallow a whistle
[The Stooges did it first](https://youtu.be/Cn_L26MW6nU?t=140)
Serious question, when the dude said "open" why did the kid breathe in and close his mouth??? 
Can you imagine being the doctor that treats him and trying not to crack up when he inhales. 
If you;ve had asthma before you aint laughing at that constricted breathing believe me. 
That's the hardest I've laughed in months. Actually have tears in my eyes.I know it's not funny for the family or the kid... but then he opens his mouth and... *honk*
Poor kid. He's so done. That's the face of "It was funny at first but now it kinda hurts and also annoying."
This shouldn‚Äôt be funny but I laugh so hard üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
He looks profoundly depressed. 
That's some cartoon quality shit right there.
I laughed.I‚Äôm not sorry.
mAaMaAmAA
SoFlo finding new ways to get views
The face of regret 
His eyes are not happy. 
He knows he did something dumb, you can see it in his eyes. I want to hug him. Do you think he would squeak.
this is as good as i thought it was
At least it was caught it before it got like that last story about the guy who had a playmobil traffic cone in his lung.
He rocks in the treetop all day long 
You blew it kid
üòÇthis poor kiddo. I cannot help but laugh though....
When my asthma acts up it can sound exactly like that, sometimes even worse
Poor Lil guy. What do u even do in this type of a situation? 
Lots of posts, sorry, didn't read them all.  Isn't asking him to inhale like that and duplicate the whistle extremely fucking dangerous?  Couldn't he suck it deeper and potentially create a chocking or lung damaging issue?
The face the kid makes right after the squeak noise is so damn cute.
This is why the internet exists, just for these special moments.
Should i smile or not
Nooooo, this can't be real.
I don't think i've ever laughed so hard. Well, there was this one time this guy got castrated by accident when he was mistaken for another patient. During the interview the host laughed so hard at the victim. I laughed rather strongly then, also. I'm not ashamed to laugh. 
Does this kid remind anyone else of SoFlow Antonio?
as an asthmatic, this makes me both laugh and cringe
of course it had to be a chubby kid.. why is it always the chubby ones... lmao
This is terrible. Poor kid.
He did not choose the duck life, the duck life chose him
I never thought of swallowing a whistle, but swallowing a balloon is one of my biggest fears.  Trying to breathe in inflates the balloon in your throat, making it even harder to get air... *shivers*
I see makeup, colorful wigs, and a red nose in his future. 
So many opportunities wasted. 
You are what you eat
I expected it. I knew what was coming. And I still laughed my ass off
Anyone else think of the dog from Snatch?
This almost happened to me when I was like 12 years old, they sell these things in Sweden although they are illegal to sell because you can choke on them. So anyways I bought one and you usually blow outwards to make that funny sound, but it also makes a different sound when you blow inwards too (although it's not intended to be used this way) So when I did that I lost grip of it and it flew down my throat really fast and I choked on it and instantly was able to cough it up thankfully. But damn that shit made me panic badly. It could be compared to something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaS6diS7pF8)
That expression though.
Can someone one make the beat of "take on me" using the whistle?
He needs to be nose breathing to lower inspiratory pressure otherwise risk lodging the whistle differently
Am I the only one who thinks it's just a kid making a silly noise and the title is bullshit? A lot of people seem to think the opposite. 
Seems fake
Kids are getting real obese at a young age these days
Bad idea, from a Nurses point of view, inhaling intentionally  to make it squeak may cause it to go further down in the esophagus. 
It had to be a fat kid.
sucks for the kid
/r/thisismylifenow
You can‚Äôt tell by the kids face that the person recording had been laughing at him previously and then was like ‚ÄúHold on, hold on, let me record this shit...‚Äù
This is why Cracker Jack toys started to suck. 
You wait until he farts...
Reminds me of that scene in Snatch where the dog swallows the squeaky toy hahahaha
Reminds me of Wheezy from Toy Story.
I didnt even watch the video and I'm already laughing
... why the fuck was there an ad within a gif?!
Bad parents like this lads are the reason smartphones were invented. This made my god damn night. 
This isn‚Äôt funny at all. Once that whistle turn sideways, the kid won‚Äôt be able to breathe.
Disappointed. No fat jokes. 
accidentally?chubbs was chewing on it and here we are. 
he‚Äôs a fuckin orb
My 10yo inhaled a small lego last year. He had the same defeat in his eyes. Sounded more like Wheezy from Toy Story though.
Maybe don't eat everything in sight fatty lol
Where's /u/fuckswithducks when you need him.
He should just keep it in there
Wait this is only supposed to happen in cartoons.
The real origin story of the X-Men.
I swallowed a toy whistle as a kid. Sadly, I made no such noises.
Lil dude swallowed a party horn. 
i want to hear him laugh with that. 
Looney Tunes predicting the future since 1930
I know this is wrong to say, but it woulda been so much funnier if it made it out the other end.

Is this how geeses are made
I feel like making him inhale deeper is a horrible idea. 
How do we subscribe to the update when he farts a tune?
I haven't had a post that made me laugh out loud in a long time. This so easily could have been me when I was younger. 
That‚Äôs his ‚Äú I dun fucked up‚Äù face.

The crazy thing was that Calvin was actually a really smart kid, and his downfall was that he was lazy and didn't want to work on anything that didn't immediately interest him. He was really bad at math, but had more vocabulary as a 6 year old than most people have at 20
The moron couldn‚Äôt even put a zipper on right.  It‚Äôs no wonder he works in a sweatshop.
Is it bad that I remember this specific comic? 
I love Calvin and Hobbes, but to be fair, you have to have a pretty high IQ to...

"clever" people are cursed in that way I think, slowly realizing people are stupid, then increasingly becoming upset with them, for that reason.If its true or not doesnt even matter either
I love the part where he's like, "Is someone coming to steal my rocks? No? Okay, back to playing!"
How he manages to not drop them is beyond me
I too wanted this to be here after seeing [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/73bjxk/til_that_sea_otters_have_a_pocket_set_across/) about how otters carry a rock with them all their life.  
When I was young I didn't understand why Brian Jacques made all the best characters in Redwall otters. It's because he was a smart man and he knew that otters are simply the greatest.
As a geologist, this is what it do when I find samples.
I am extremely impressed at his ability to not drop them, the coordination is great for those little arms. 
This is the weirdest cute thing I have ever seen.
The way he holds them close to his chest at the end

Otterly ridiculous

Don't be fooled by the rocks that she's got 
Otters like 2 rock.
I just read through the comments, and do I really get to be the first person to point out that he looks... Otterly stoned?
Where's its little rock pocket?
If they've been having fun being little derps since the late miocene, imagine what else we don't know about.

Its a Harlem Globe otter.
The weird part is how animated the rocks look as he tosses them about 
He has more coordination then I could ever hope to have.
I wish I was born an otter
I‚Äôll never forget when I first started playing with my two rocks 
Is this before or after it raped a baby seal to death?. Thats right guys, otters are notorious for raping and killing baby seals.
at first I thought he was trying to get rid of the stone but then I realize he was playing with those...unbelievable
This furry bastard is more coordinated than I‚Äôll ever be. 
Americas got talent?
Oh my god his hand picking up the fallen rock. So freakin adorable!
A real athlete! Olympic champion! Should this be recognized as an Olympic sport in your view?

I'm going to apologize.. for nothing at all.  This is the most satisfying gif ever.
They are not rocks, they're DIAMONDS!
It's rude to be filming people at the gym he's obviously trying to lose weight stop fat shaming him.

David Bowie was reincarnated as an otter.
I knew I'd see this here after seeing it on TIL
I'm actually quite surprised that he manages to balance them pretty well.
I wonder if someone dressed as a otter could show these otters how to use rocks as projectiles essentially heralding in the use of tools and evolution of otters leaving them closer to being a sentient being leading to otters and humans becoming cohabitants leading to us sharing offices, houses, schools, streets, etc. That'd be pretty cool

Ok I've been practicing for this!

next step would be otter juggling rocks -> juggling otter rocks
This is me when playing Destiny 2 home alone but all of a sudden I hear the door.. but then realise it's the postman.
Based on this gif i'm like 70% sure i could teach this otter how to juggle.
Aye! I know where you picked this up from!
Even more primitiver technology
The pause is like when your mum shouts 'Your dinner is on the table!', you shout back 'Just five more minutes!', and then just keep playing regardless of what she says next.
He's practically juggling...
Put those back in your pockets!

Add the third one and she will be juggling in no time!
Now he can smash more skulls like a clam on his tummy.
This is the best thing I have ever seen on reddit. 
I wish i was an otter...
Omggg that's so cute
He looks up like he just shown his new amazing mating ritual and hope someone saw it.

These are my rocks. There are many like them but these are mine!

After learning yesterday what an "otter" is, this headline sounded really different to me.
At least someone is having fun
Now I want 2 rocks.
HAHHAHAHA
Juggle juggle juggle juggle FREEZE!
That otter has better moves than most humans.
So much fun with two rocks, look what I can do!!! Hello?!? Anybody seeing this?
Never had two at a time, and now I'm married, so I sort of live vicariously through young otters like this.
Thus begins the otters foray into capitalism and the acquisition of material goods. 
This otto will soon get a boyfriend
I'm curious what happened after.
There are so many rocks around the Otter too.
Otters. So hot right now.
"Jesus Christ Pete, they're minerals!"
You think this is cute. But _he killed for those rocks_. He took it off of another otter.
This guy is a super famous juggler in the otter world.
Such a cheeky rascal.

What game is this guy playing? 
He Otter Rock! 
0 fucks given.
I wish I had 2 rocks... I only have 1 rock on my desk :(
that dexterity tho!!! this is almost juggling!!!
Is he trying to juggle?
From what I just learned on a previous Reddit he has a pouch for one... Maybe he can squeeze in two... But the larger issue is I can't remember what subreddit that was!
I hope her date goes well
That's adorable ü§ó
Otters rock... 
GENIE: "...and for your third wish?"
Two rocks and one otter 
Is it just me, or does the physics of how these rocks are being juggled seem a little off? Until he rolls over to check if anyone's watching... WHICH THERE IS! Oh he's just a guy wth a camera. Back to these mystical stones
I wish I would be as happy playing with 2 Stones
**two.***two?***i just found two rocks!**
Perhaps this is the meaning to life, rocks. He seems so relaxed and contempt with life having those two rocks. He really does not need anything else. I should get some rocks.

This is so freaking adorable. I want a pet otter now.
Grew up in Alaska. I‚Äôve seen them do this floating in the water with clam shells. Makes a cool clicking noise ;)
That otter looks about as happy as someone with two wives would be.
"Rocks! Yaaaaay!"
"While you were off trying to mate, I studided the rock."
Me when I try to juggle. ...actually that might be giving me too much credit.
I can already tell this otter has better hand-eye coordination than me...
Just like a human with two knives. 
As a guy with a collection of nice, smooth lake rocks, I understand completely.
 I love otters so much 
Gee Billy, 2 rocks?
This looks like the perfect gif where people add faces to inanimate objects to give emotion. I could just see the rocks having a ball then being suspicious when the otter becomes suspiciousIf only I had some artistic talent...
Otters are known for having special rocks that they use as tools. They carry them with them everywhere.
Ha!  Watched this and Dueling Banjo‚Äôs was on and made it waaaaay cool!
I guess you could say he's totally... stoned. hahahagahahha

What if you are like me and just put the toilet paper standing up on a table? Which do I choose?
I can‚Äôt even begin to figure out how to game this choice. I feel like behind is the least popular choice, but will it attract better players?
Stop giving an equal voice to the side that has been proven false countless times.

I'm all for team front, but I heard a compelling argument for Behind in that its useful if you have cats.Just trying to play devil's avocado here.
Guess they finally put the clearly obvious correct answer on pearls side to push everyone to vote on that side.
Theres 2 kinds of people in this world, those who correctly put the TP on the front and cold hearted scum.

Team behind is going to win. The less popular choice always does.

If any splatfest ever mattered more...
At first I laughed then I remembered that I'm in the EU region :\
crap, hoping the NA splatfest isn't this date as well. gonna be in a hotel room :(
They should do a black & blue dress and white & gold dress splatfest too
I feel this one is just too one-sided to work
What are they doing? Do they WANT to destroy the world with this argument?
Hanging their toilet paper underneath?!That's a paddling. 
holy SHIT nintendo
Ew
SHIET!!!
Well, front of course, we are all gentlemen here.
Non-cat owners vs cat owners
I love marina but I cant defend this...

Oh no I hope this isn't for NA too. We don't need another super skewed Splatfest

Another no brainer 
Bleh. Water bidet master race
Is this a splatfest, or are we trying to be satan here?
left:normal people / right: heathens
Under is easier to pull off with one hand. Try it. It also gives you more room if the TP holder is closer to the toilet.
Oh my god. A user posted these icons a couple of days ago on Reddit saying "Finally I'm doing something good for humanity". Omg he worked on Splatoon 2.
Next Splatfest: Are you standing or sitting while wiping? I mean, apparently this is a real question. I've heard people saying both things, so... (Not gonna state what I'm doing, for reasons ya know).
If Behind wins, we blow up the Earth.
[I do this.](http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/toilet-paper-on-window-sill-picture-id539624628)Have I been temp banned from playing Splatoon this weekend?
Utterly disgraceful. Disgusting! I quit this game!  
over not under-fosters 
Look, all I'm saying is if you pick Team Behind, you are literally a garbage-tier human being, and you deserve to be eradicated.I don't think that's too extreme.  It's just a fact.
My girlfriend is one of the few that likes it from behind.
Really it depends whether or not you have pets that find wasting toilet paper is a blast.
I'm here wondering what the difference is. *Why not both?*
I bet the American Splatfest is gonna be some super cool licensed character shit. 
Shitposting *and* taking the piss... Beautiful.
Perhaps in a smaller washroom so the next square isn't damp from the shower
What if you just sit I on top of it lol 
Seriously
Now these are the true issues facing our nation today.
This may be the bast thing I have ever seen. 
Oh I'm in! I hate when it's not in front. Lol

Well, that's the last thing I expected.
what the fuck
This is amazing lol.
It's like this: Your nose could have been upside down and you would still breath fine. Your nose would still be wrong though.
Am I the only one on the toilet right now that felt the need to check and switch the toiletpaper direction?
Pearls won. 
lmao Is this real? . This is really random. üòÇ
Is this a rhetorical question? 
Thanks splatoon. You just started the biggest fight of my marriage. Why must you ruin families like this? I‚Äôll be sending Nintendo a bill for my attorney fees for my impending divorce. 
But really which team should I pick so I get consistent matches with the opposite team instead of Toilet roll front vs Toilet roll front
Shit just got real.
Really Nintendo? I prefer if you gave us the McDonald's one.
Lol I don't even know what side to choose since we don't even have a toilet roll holder at home. 
Europe applies to Australia right?
Discriminating! What about those, who just put it sideways, stick a finger in the hole to hold it and roll it off that way?? Those damn wall mountings...witch techniques!
Honestly, I don't care either way.
Finally this can be resolved, through cartoon violence. 
You are joking. This is the best they could come up with!?
Neither. My toilet roll holderbroke off my wall so I just store it on top of my sink
Pearl has got this.
God, these are such good ideas - it‚Äôs tribalism with paint guns!
Worst splatfest theme of all time?
they want us to stay divided. this is nintendo's master plan. \#wakeupsheeple
This needs debating?! Smh. There's only one TRUE answer!
Holy shit I've actually got that weekend off too!!!
Still just 24hrs, eh?
Toilet roll BEHIND?! What kind of monster are you?!
TIL people who put TP under are apparently scum of the earth.
Everyone else X people that owns a cat
I legitimately switch it from back to front myself if I see that way. 
Are they trying to start a war?
I think Nintendo is just maybe starting to run out of splatfest ideas.
On the one hand im not a heathen on the other hand that means supporting the ugly goblin. So which heathen do i want to be.
Huh im on marinas side for once
It bums me out that pearl keeps getting the options I agree with, despite my distaste in her.
Sorry Marina, Pearls right this time
There is only one correct choice lol
do people really care about this? ive never even noticed which way round it is? sometimes i just leave it on the bench instead
Who cares. Just wipe your fucking ass. 
Toilet paper for guests hands for hosts.Wife said toilet paper origami always gets folded in the front.
Never understood why anyone cared about this tbh.
.......... Please don't let this be the US Splatfest..... 
Another good debate: Lightly lift butt and wipe or stand up and wipe?
Um... Is this an actual debate? Can my choice be "Who the fuck cares?"?
If it's to the left of me I like it in front, if it's to the right of me I prefer it behindSource: dorm has it to left of me home has it to right
Umm.... Ok...
Is this seriously a thing? Who pays attention to how their toilet roll is facing? Lol
Behind is objectively superior because you can see if a bug is hiding in the fold.

What's the context for this image?Anyone have some historical knowledge as to why this happened?
Man, severed heads have never really freaked me out much. A body without a head gets me waaaay more.
One of the few NSFW posts here that actually made me uneasy :(
A lot less blood here than film has led me to expect. 
People commenting "omg this barbaric thing happened only 100 years ago"This sort of shit still happens today, my dude.
Makes you think about how peaceful of a time we live in, relatively speaking. 
Can someone shed light on the way the bodies are bound? It looks like a noose around the neck and tied to the hands. Seems like the rope would apply pressure to the neck if they tried to get their hands free.
God humanity can be truly awful sometimes. 
The movies make it seemLike there would be pools of blood 
Why did I click on this? 
And this is called the SFW porn network. Damn, this is so brutal. Really makes you think just how new civilized practices of today are. 
Chinese history is seriously fucked up. The real Game of Thrones, no joke. Even Indian history can't hold a candle.
Why is this being called "porn" (even figuratively)? Seems distasteful and more than anything really weird.
[removed]
I don't mind but maybe a nsfl tag?
You'd think something this barbaric, how it looks "normal" to the onlookers would be from another age. But nah, just early 1900's.
The inevitable conclusion when you try to stifle peaceful protesting is violent revolution. As JFK said. 
Did they live?
For some reason, I always expected beheadings to be more bloody. 
Not as bloody as I thought it would be, considering there's a major artery system in there.
Some of my thoughts on the aftermath. Perhaps I should turn this into a book?> The aftermath of the Xinhai Revolution wasn't very simple, either: while Sun Yat-sen was indeed elected Provisional President of the Republic of China, in late December of 1911, it was somewhat of a position in name only. Now, remember: China, as a territory, is massive, and Sun and his revolutionaries only controlled southern China, up to, more or less, the Yangtze River; any failure to secure northern China would have created a gap in security, leading to banditry, raiders, possible counter-attacks by the Qing Empire, and so on. Speaking of the Qing Empire, the functionaries and officers of that government could still, to an extent, claim international and diplomatic recognition: so something would have to be done to topple them totally and completely to ensure international recognition of the Republic.> > Now, the revolutionaries weren't idiots: they knew this, and they had a plan. You see, to overthrow the Qing dynasty once and for all, they, pressured by Western powers, decided to strike a deal with General Yuan Shikai, the Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet and the commander of the finest army in China, the Beiyang Army. (Well-trained, well-armed, and massive, the Beiyang Army was still a force to be reckoned with, even after its losses from single-handedly fighting the Japanese in the First Sino-Japanese War.)>Why would a trusted general, the Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet, negotiate with revolutionaries? That answer is simple: like General Zeng Guofan, the Qing government would drop him after he had outlived his usefulness. So Yuan chose to negotiate[...]>In exchange for his help in overthrowing the six-year-old Pu Yi, thus breaking the back of the Great Qing, freeing the north for nominal reunification, and extirpating the last vestiges of foreign Manchu domination from the government; the Provisional Republic would surrender the presidency to Yuan. Afterwards, perhaps, the reunification would continue, with the Beiyang Army at the head of the Republic's forces, crushing warlords, spreading the word of the Three Principles of the People, and singing the "Song to the Auspicious Cloud" as they liberated peasants and bondsmen from the fear and terror of bandits and thieves. [...]>The best-laid schemes of mice and men often go awry.But that is a story for another day.
Wow.....I guess that must've been a weight off their shoulders once it was over....
Jesus, are they ok?
How is a NSFW picture part of the SFWPorn network?
Just think if some early soccer players, like visiting from Belgium, came running up kicking a head to the left then right then on the toes then bouncing on the knee and bopping it into the crowd on the left side *ahhhhhh!!* and then someone there headbutts it over to the crowd on the right side *ahhhhhh!!* "Ohhh, you roundeyes make to much horror!!"
How painful is this style of beheading?
Appalling what humans can do to each other. What a shame!
This isnt history porn, this is just regular porn
I thought the one child policy was harsh 
It‚Äôs so sad that life can be so instantly taken like that 
Why are humans so unreasonably sadistic?
Why must this sub be called historyporn?!?
1911? Jesus I know that's over 100 years ago but that just seems really recent for something so brutal. Then again ww1 and 2 followed not long after. 
China is such a beautiful place but their history is just tragic, war, massacre, massacre, revolution, massacre and so on.
At times like this I realize that we should have two types of nsfw. I never mind seeing a titty, but I did not need to see this at 6am while waiting to board a plane and having been up for hours. 
THIS is what we need in washington.(15 min from now, a knock on my door....)
Their bodies seem so little and deflated. :( 
Is that a tongue hanging out! That is freaking me out. 
I'm guessing these were done quickly with a sword not hacking aware with knife 
Don't know why I looked... what was I expecting
young kitten got it bad cuz i'm blackand white..... wait a minute....
He even looks tough. If I were a cat, I wouldn't mess with him.
Clearly kitter is not sitting, is loafing. No rulez broken here
This is Istanbul, clearly the cat can't read English.
I'm sure I've seen this same cat in Dubrovnik... https://imgur.com/gallery/dIo8l 
CWA, Straight Outta Nom-ton
He ain't even kneeling
I just think loafing in front of a police station shows such disrespect to our troops and our men in uniform.  I wish these black cats would peacefully protest in a way that makes me feel not threatened...oh, who am I kidding?  I'll complain no matter what.

This image is so old it's made out of asbestos.It's still kinda funny though, although a little itchy x.x
Save and repost it in a few months to shamelessly get a few karma?
You retards this is is an islamic depiction of Ali, the Patron Saint‚Ñ¢ of Shia muslims, he is allowed to be depicted. This is more /r/therewasanattempt... 
This isn't Muhammad, you daft cunts. Thats Ali actually lol
No. No karma whoring for you!
The only reason Muslims don't want drawings of Mohammed is because they don't want people worshipping Mohammed, like the way people worship Jesus.A drawing of Jesus and a drawing Mohammed are equally bad according to the principals of Islam.So where's the outrage from Muslims about all depictions of Jesus?  None, because the triggered Muslims barely know anything about their own religion.
Is this jesus
It's not Muhammad you fucking idiots.
The dude's been portrayed in muslim art, bro. Made by muslims. Try harder. 
... Why
Yep!*/Respects their wishes and doesn't put it up anywhere/*If it's not harming you then why the fuck not just respect their religion
Lol. If you want to be offensive why not post one of the pictures that truly offend Muslims? Like the bomb in turban one.
continue eating my sandwich? I honestly don't know what to do.
That's uh... that's actually an impressive beard.
Why would they want a picture of Russel Brand removed? 
you were supposed to draw a dick on his forehead like he had in real life
Looks like your average child-fucker, what's the outrage for.
Mohammed sucks pig dicks in hell
"So it was, as many pre-teen wives as one can take, thus is the will of God."

If there's one thing that really makes a video of Guitar Hero great, it's taking out all the music.
Perfect example of how Guitar Hero created a great game that requires good dexterity and learned skill, yet made music completely joyless. 
Only the eyebrow gives away that he knows he is awesome. 
Man, after watching that I've never felt so impressed and yet so saddened at the same time before.
A little disappointed that his fingers didn‚Äôt actually catch fire when the buttons on the screen did.
I was in several Guitar Hero tournaments back in the day. In the second one I was in I met a guy who could get 100% on "Through the Fire and the Flames" on Expert, but that is nothing compared to this dude. I miss those tournaments. 
This motherfucker didnt even blink lol 
*Through the fire and flames we carry on!!!*
Please tell me this kid plays real guitar also. His fingers move with such grace. Kid could really shred. 
 I did raining blood 93% on expert in high school.. never played that game again..
Do you have to sell your soul and joy to become this good?
OMG He looks so happy!
[removed]
Star power!
He should probably just pick up a guitar...
I mean, at this point just learn the guitar 
Gotta love how he has long hair like an actual rock star,  but has sunken literally thousands of hours into mashing buttons in a plastic guitar.
If he put that time into actually playing guitar, he might be a really good, if not excellent, guitarist. 
Could somebody explain to me why you he doesn't have to strum on the fast parts, but he does On the slower parts? 
I can almost say I know this songs just from the beat he's playing on. But can't quite put my finger on it.Anyway, watching him never miss a single one was some serious asmr
Magic fingers, ladies.
Thats a finger benchmark
Okay now that im done warming up ill play a really hard song 
Man this guy doesn't need to blink oO
/r/notarobot
I‚Äôm not even mad that I can‚Äôt play those types of songs. They‚Äôre too insane.
Dude‚Äôs not even blinking. 
looks at his eyes. He does not blink once when its going to get crazy. this makes a guitar hero player. ;) 
Well that escalated quickly
I need to be this guy when I grow up.
That's....pretty impressive 
I kew this game was fun. Look at him !
meet osu
This goes to show you: never believe your parents when they say you will never accomplish anything.
You crushed it
Kinda looks like my exgf
Thad?!
Did he even blink?! 
I wonder what this guy could achieve if he spent the same amount of time playing a real guitar as he did playing Guitar Hero.
Why not learn the instrument???
This dude will never get laid!
Girls be calling nonstop 
If you are still playing Guitar Hero in 2017, it definitely is a lifestyle at this point. 
I played the shit out of guitar hero back in the day. That being said, I didn't know it was still a thing. Why not take up an actual instrument? 
Came to say make your bed.
Get this man a girlfriend!
And here I was insisting I wouldn't mind playing bass every time so no one would see that i couldn't play chords.
Can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs good or just button bashing!
Who would upload a fucking gif of guitar hero
*These are just rookiongse s*
How long would of that took to get that good 
More from her: https://imgur.com/a/SxSdB

This is real question.  I'm a woman.  Do men still like small asses?  Like naturally normal but trim asses?
So much work done on her.
r/anisyia
She looks like a centaur
I imagine this is why women take so much longer in the bathroom. This goes on every time...
Here's a nice clip of her all cute and naked, pranking a pizza delivery guy: https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=ph5769ccff8af21
With tattoos that say "'My older brother and I have a very strange and unhealthy closeness"
That spinal curve 
ITT: shes hot but shes got a lotta weirdness about her thats hard to point out 
Damn! Epic Ass to Waist ratio....completely amazing. Great ass shelf, I could put a drink or two on there while I was fucking her from behind. :D
She's the best looking mom at the pta
She's got a minotaur look going for her in that gif
Omg........
I could watch that gif for the rest of my time!
I need one of these ~~
Ass could be real the tits are not. Still great hips, perfect to grab a hold of while nailing her doggy.
Outstanding culo
HOLY CHRIST! This chick could be a racist, child murdering, nazi sympathizer and I would only hesitate for a moment. 
Is there a subreddit dedicated to gifs of girls spreading their ass like that? 
Wow
Nice ass, but she moves like either a retard or a robot
She looks like Emily ratijkowski 
Nice ass, but her body has a strange shape.Like really fucking strange. I can't even explain it. 
That ass looks so disproportionately phat
I hope she wiped.
That's a great ass anywhere 
r/uncannyvalley
Wow. That's...... really impressive 
Wayyy to thin imo. Looks unhealthy. Great ass tho. 
Wonder how her feet look
damn she's got the most obvious romanian face ever
Oh I used to know her name. She's probably the sexiest woman I've ever seen
Jesus Larry Christ, man.
If she's Venezuelan then she'd probably give you that ass for a few cans of food.
wqho
Damn what a fantastic ass!
Am a breastman meself but god damn...
Damn
stop fishing
Stop fishing. It's sad. 
Stop fishing for validation. 
If you think you're going to feel better after a million random internet strangers tell you that you're stunning and all, think again. 
Karma won't replace the absence of your father growing up
No
Just fuckin stop
nah, don't bother 
No, and put some pants on

Eh.

These comments lol
No, fuck off you attention deprived cunt.
No
Khama searching!
Now I know why your boyfriend left you. Stop it. This shit is not healthy for you.
The way this one went, I'm surprised the post is still up and hasn't been deleted yet 
üé£üé£üé£ get out
Attention whoring because you're not getting attention in real life?
Fuck no nigga
No and you can GET THE HELL OUT!                                            -Tobias F√ºnke
What sort of thirst do you have that you need to delete and then repost because no one noticed?Edit: I was expecting this comment to be downvoted to hell, I didn't know there were this many logical Redditors.
Absolutely not
No.
no
Awwww, poor attention whore.
You got a weird vagina.
No
no

One of the reasons I love Reddit ... you never know how the comments will go. There are probably dozen of this exact type of post in many other subs.  Yet they are all probably comments like "no you look great!", "can't believe no noticed", "awesome"... you never know "what you gonna get".
No enough is enough.
cry more
nah, you can stop.
no
Looks like a dude
No. 
not if you keep fishing.
Mods should honestly delete this tragedy of a post. Woman makes loads of comments and threads and some people claim she's fishing for compliments so now there's a witch hunt. 
Loving the shit out of these comments. Never change Reddit.
no, do all of us a favor and delete this account too
Pretty sure this is a post-op tranny.
Rick and morty mouth. 
Yuck
I have never mass-downvoted so many comments on a post hitting /r/all in months.Thanks for the laugh 
lol brutal
Chicken neck pussy.
In the realm of self-published internet porn, you'd think that such a concept as "integrity" would be utterly irrelevant. But as it turns out, even though the floor is lower, it's a *much harder floor*. I don't approve of the ugly behavior in these comments, but unfortunately I see why they're happening:  It isn't honest to delete posts. And when someone shows a lack of integrity, it provokes a lack of respect in others. Unfortunately nobody's gonna not-be-a-dick just because being a dick isn't okay. If you'd like to see a change in behavior and your posts receiving more adequate attention, you're going to have to be patient, consistent, and reliable.I for one would have liked to see you post more, but not if you're going to destroy it afterward; then you're just leaving a trail of spam... 
Are you kidding? Of course you should post more. Im sure this will get to the front page
Unleash those pierced turtees and you'll be front page üòâ
Down voting.
no
No need to keep posting if you're just going to delete it because you're starved for attention.
Maybe you should have posted a better picture of your cunt. People are picky here. No attention seeking tho, this shit turns me off like nothing else 
So you‚Äòre desperately seeking attention from others because you think you‚Äòre only worth something if other people like or love you.Trust me, this won‚Äòt work. I‚Äòve been there. Love yourself to the point where you literally don‚Äòt care (well you care, but you don‚Äôt let it define who you are) what others think because you finally know that your opinion is the only that matters.
Butthole or GTFO.
Did this thread get brigaded by /r/incels?
Shes got a morty..  like r/simps but more mortyish
Why do you, or anyone for that matter, crave the attention of internet strangers so much? I think you should delete this, and the next cute guy you see, you should ask out. Instead of ruining future aspects of a loving partner or job opportunities because you decided you were lonely one evening and  thought you were ugly.
no
No. Delete your account forever.
I mean.. 
THE WHORE IS PREGNANT
I‚Äôm going to get downvoted to hell, but how you all stop being assholes? Looking past the obviously hypocrisy of responding to someone seeking attention by GIVING HER ATTENTION, what are you gaining from this? If she is attention seeking like this she might have a real problem  with self esteem and doesn‚Äôt need this shit from bandwagon jumping trolls, and if she is just an attention seeking asshole then ignoring her will make her stop. Being a bunch of dickholes is only achieving the opposite of what you‚Äôre trying to do. 
Is it just me or do her lips look like rick Sanchez lips? 
Please don't. Makes it easier for everyone around here, including yourself.
Just spread the vulva already.
i love all the acceptable criticism about how stupid this post is yet it still has 6k+ upvotes, reddit is fucking stupid, downvote this dumb fuck if you're also posting how stupid the post history/post itself is...
Define ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get any love...‚Äù   because what little I see looks damn good.   Relax - this is supposed to be fun!  Don‚Äôt let people‚Äôs opinions influence how you feel about yourself.  I tend bar - I see girls who look like models blank and girls I think are plain get hit on all night.  How you feel about yourself shows through. So relax and enjoy - who gives a shit how many votes you get?  You look hot as hell and now everybody knows it! 
No, please go away. 
Such a darling shot! Thank you.
Gross arms, little boy hips, and it looks like you're just tucking a dick like Buffalo Bill.
Do whatever you want.

Oh my good God, Yes!I love you! You needing a Daddy, by chance, Baby girl ?
Hey, that's calmer than most people. The rest of us would instinctively drop it on the floor and then panic when it scatters
Is the sink crying/ screaming?
This happened to me but with a bee on my neck, most terrifying experience ever.
It's stuff like this that makes me glad I'm from Alberta Canada, the one place on Earth where there are no cockroaches. (Or rats!)
Source?
Fun fact: cockroaches are actually extremely hygienic creatures, and are constantly cleaning themselves.
One time I was sitting in class and there was an itch on my neck. I went to scratch it only to feel something on my fingers that wasn't skin. I grab whatever is on my neck and it's a giant beetle. I throw that thing across the room. The good thing is that nobody seemed to notice the ordeal I just went through. 
Why throw it out the window? Set it on fire.
Is Their Story slowly taking over this sub? I'm fine with this...
Careful fam, this is Taken De Gushi. It's cute, adorable, and full of warm fuzzies and laughs. I didn't care that everyone was gay. It was just something I used to read to pick me up after a bad day. But be warned, this is a gate way drug. After I caught up, I wanted more. I made the mistake of looking for similar material on Tumblr. Now I'm knee deep sucked into all this BL and GL Smut to the point I make myself cringe.
Nope.
Don't flatter yourself, cockroach just needed to get somewhere quick. It's not like he wanted you touching him, baaaaka. 
I go through the same exact process when I move a bug, I'm impressed they go the expression right 
why do her eyes turn into sunnyside up eggs?
RIP   #cockroachfeelingsmatter
This actually happened to me yesterday, was trying to sleep and one crawl in my back ;-;
Gah, this is too real to me.I was looking out my screen door at a storm in the dark and I heard something fly around then felt something hit my back. Turn the lights on and theirs this giant roach running around. We had a battle after that with the storm in the background.
This was literally me last night when a beetle crawled between my toes.
You always grab and kill them, smash them then flush them. They have pheromones in their bodies to leave as a trial, so don't throw the body in the trash flush it hard and fast. My apartment gets them every few months. I buy some RaID traps and throw them around outside my apartment and after a few days they are gone for months. 
I stopped at an outhouse while learning to drive with my mom. I will never know when or how a cicada got in my shirt, but it was in there for a full 30 minutes until I got home before I discovered it.
Reminds of the time I had a mite on my neck.
Cockroachs are actually very clean and gentle. I've had to catch them by hand before, slippery little bastards but not too intelligent.
Okay I don't understand. Someone explain please
I do all that and cry to my mommy
QUI TOOONG Zzzz
I've done something similar, but it was in my hair *and it was a bee*

I did this once with  3 inch long centipede that got on my back when I was drying off with a towel after a shower, except I wasn't nearly as composed. I did the "shriek like a little girl while flailing my hands around" dance... 
This meme gives me anxiety
This happened to me but it was in 9th grade in the middle of a class

Ugh it's the worst during the small amount of time when you are processing what just happened and it's moving around that's the worst. Fuck. Fucking goosebumps every time!

"Hehe we got you!""Hehe you got me!"
This looks like one of those stock photos when you type ‚Äòpolice and protesters‚Äô that you laugh at because how unreal it looks
"We don't *really* want to arrest him.""It's OK guys, you're just doing your job!"
The female cop and the protester look really happy for some reason.The male cop just looks really serene, like he's above all this petty nonsense that's going on in the physical plane.
"Lets get this goofball outta here""Weeee I'm getting carried"
God you're right it looks like a J crew catalog
Hey the Pepsi finally worked.

Can‚Äôt wait for the movie starring (from left to right) Amy Adams, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Ryan Phillipe. 
Is this a model shoot why is everyone so attractive 
This looks like a hiring poster for the police. "Every day is something new at the NYPD!"
Geez, even their people are well engineered.
Can confirm this is not fake.Source: I played enough Rainbow Six Siege to know that's how you spell Police in German.
Germans are hott. 
It's looks like if protests were a Gilbert and Sullivan musical.
Would be great to know if this was just a practice drill with one of their own. Actually saw a similar scene of young trainees while traveling in China. The ‚Äòprotester‚Äô was even wearing grey clothes just like the guy in this pic. They weren‚Äôt beaming this much, but it was obvious they were mixing work with fun. The big difference was, as soon as I tried to take a pic, they roughly escorted me out of the park, smiles turned to frowns, violently yelling me down with clubs in hand. 
That is an infectious smile, all right.
 For a second I thought the female officer was wearing a holster on a holster. And I thought Germany was pretty badass.Then I realized it's a completely separate person. 
Eins, zwei,Polizei.Drei, vier,Offizier.*Edit:* Thanks to /u/BummerMan for politely noting my spelling error.

I just remembered the rhyme from high school German classes... then, later, failed to listen to any popular music for certain decades.
That protester looks as if he was the offspring of both of the cops.

Animal rights protesters during a G7 summit: apparently, they blockaded a slaughterhouse. M√ºnchen, 2015: https://www.reddit.com/r/nocontextpics/comments/739coi/pic/dnom7o7/
The female officer on the left really looks like Amy Adams.
I'd take him in.
To give a bit of context: This happened at the G7 summit in munich 2015. Some animal rights movement blocked the road to a slaughterhouse. The police then had to physically remove them from the street.

Thought the guy on the right had a weird face or the picture wasn't taken right, realised there's another guy behind. 
They are all so young and good looking. I gaze at them listlessly with tears of longing as I stoke the flickering memories of my own vitality. I pace the cold, empty halls of my mind and I dream of the warm blood that once sustained my whithering tissues. The flowers of my past lay crusted and blackened upon the worn stones at the feet of father time.

Wow.  This is basically an ad for Modern German Society.
Meanwhile... in the US of A....
German police peeps are some of the nicest. I was at a bar once in Berlin, and we were making a little too much noise out on the street as the bar was packed. So, an officer came up to me. Asked my Language, and then politely told me and my buds (in the nicest possible way) that if we could go inside the bar, and if we didn‚Äôt then gave me a list of options of other places that were good. No shouting. No anger. Just politeness and we moved on to another bar. And did shots. He had the most epic smile.
"Haha, getting arrested is so much fun!"
Psh... This image has been doctored, guys.[Here's the original image.](https://i.imgur.com/yD7yb1d.png)

Female cop played by Isla Fisher or Amy Adams
The cop on the left makes me want to break the law.

Protester: "Her hand's on my penis :]."Girl cop: "I'm on camera :]."Guy cop: "My hand's on his penis :]"
You know they all shared a Pepsi before this pic
When Jager and IQ work together.
"Oh it's such a perfect day~""I'm glad I spent it with you~"
He's hitting on her but she laughs not because it's cute but because of all the butt stuff he will be enduring down at the police station. The male cop laughs because he she is his gf and knows why she is laughing as well - the protestor thinks he's charming
It looks like they had just captured the guy and removed him from the area, and he went right back. The woman officer is laughing that he was caught a second time. The man is all, "ya got me guys!" The male officer is kind of all "here we go again... üòí" but he's also trying not to laugh about the situation.

Honestly, which one? Good looking group of people
This is a Mentos commercial. 
Hey, I know you! You're Kareem Abdul-Jabbar!
"Listen Betty, don't start up with your white zone shit again."I had the pleasure of seeing this long time favorite in theatres a couple weeks ago. Classic 
I used to try to resent this movie cause my dad liked it so much and I was an annoying teenager. But every time they make the "drinking problem" joke I die.
Great!  Now watch Top Secret!
Tell me, have you ever seen a grown man naked?
"It's a large building full of patients, but that's not important right now."
Leslie Nielsen really made many good comedy movies.  The Naked Gun trilogy and Spy Hard come to mind.  Other similar comedies I liked include- Blazing Saddles- History of the World Part 1- Life of Brian- Monty Python and the Holy Grail- Top Secret- Hot Shots (and it's sequel Part Deux)- McHale's Navy- Down PeriscopeYou know, if you're looking for more similar movies.
The jokes-per-minute ratio is insane. Nonstop hilarious. 
Picked a bad day to stop sniffing glue!
What I wouldn't give to see Airplane! again for the first time. Good for you. 
"When can we land?I can't tell.You can tell me. I'm a doctor.I mean I don't know.Well can't you take a guess?Not for another two hours.You can't take a guess for another two hours?"Always my favorite scene
"Nervous?"_'Yeah'_"First time?"_'No, I've been nervous before'_
"I take it black....like my men" had me in stitches.
That scene of the people coming off the conveyor belt and taking the suitcases that are standing around it made me convulse with laughter when I saw Airplane in the theatre. I could not stop for several minutes. It was terrifying. 
Do yourself a favor: watch it again. There are so many gags that you don't pick up on the first time through.I've probably seen it a dozen times and I still find something to laugh at every time.
damn right it is and don't ever watch it while high you may die from laughter. 
This was shown in my 8th grade school on like last day. The part where two breasts pop on screen and shake randomly was one of the high lights of my early education. :) 
You should also seek out episodes of Police Squad then. 
Tremble before the truth that this movie will *always* be as funny to you as the first time you saw it. Airplane! is one of *those*. 
A few years back researchers discovered that Airplane is the funniest movie ever made.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/9525372/Airplane-funniest-film-ever-research-finds.html
Have you ever been in a Turkish prison?
The auto pilot is deflating. :)
Great, now watch it 3 more times this week. Seriously. You'll find so many sight gags once you stop paying attention to what's in the foreground. My favorite one is when Captain Oveur is on the courtesy phone, there's a magazine rack behind him. The material sections read READING MATERIAL, SPORTS MATERIAL, WHACKING MATERIAL.
No one can play it straight like Leslie Nielson can. That guy was a genius.

I like the window cleaner near the start. Wipes the "window" after the guys walk through it.Also the 4th wall break: "What a pisser."
Zucker, Zucker and Abrahams were responsible for some of the greatest comedies of that genre (either all 3 or in part)Airplane!  Naked Gun (all 3)Top Secret!Hot Shots (I and Part Deux)  Then you have Mel Brooks...Young Frankenstein  Blazing Saddles  Robin Hood: Men in Tights  Spaceballs  
Surely, you can't be serious?
Do you know what it's like to fall in the mud and get kicked... in the head... with an iron boot? Of course you don't, no one does. It never happens. Sorry, Ted, that's a dumb question... skip that.
I watched the movie Clue (1985) last night and the humor struck me as pretty similar, so you may enjoy that as well. 
Striker‚Äôs drinking problem is such a stupid joke but so fucking  funny
My dad saw Airplane! in theaters, and he always told me one of the funniest parts for him was seeing Leslie Nielsen and Robert Stack break away from their usual serious, dramatic roles and perform deadpan comedy.The movie itself is enough to leave you in stitches, but the context of seeing serious actors you're familiar with take on such a silly role that parodied their previous work was perfect.
Blazing Saddles
Perhaps literally. It has the most jokes per minute of any film made (in the US at least)
I actually just thought about this movie for the first time in a while today.Reason why: I was stocking coffee makers at work today, and the only thing going through my mind was "I like my men like I like my coffee". Had a big stupid grin on my face for a good 10 minutes thinking about that movie.
I didn't like it. Not enough Gladiators for my taste. To each their own.
The true test of a great parody is that it still works even if you're completely unfamiliar with the source material it's parodying. That absolutely is the case with *Airplane!* which is hilarious even for those who are completely unfamiliar with source material being parodied. As it happens, I grew up watching those 70s disaster movies on VHS - particularly the aircraft disaster sub-genre. *Airplane!* so hits its target that it was impossible to take such movies seriously ever again and it effectively killed the Hollywood disaster movie stone-dead for a couple of decades. 
If you like Airplane! you should check out Angie Tribeca. Its the best parody comedy I've seen since Top Secret and Hot Shots.
Little-known side fact: Jonathan Banks, who played Mike on Breaking Bad, is one of the guys in the control room.  Check the Radar Range
I highly recommend checking out the David wain movie - They Came Together starring Paul Rudd and Amy poeler. The type of humor and amount of it is right in the same vein and league as airplane! imho(David Wain made 'wet hot American summer', which I also recommend)
One of the best moments for me involving Leslie, https://youtu.be/nTh9qpzhunE You should also watch fletch. That's a very good film!
"It's an entirely different kind of flying altogether" - Ted"It's an entirely different kind of flying" - Elaine & Dr. Rumack togetherProbably my most favourite scene in the entire movie
Go ahead and watch the sequel then.  Not as good as the first, (what is?)but certainly worth a watch!
I prefer Blazing Saddles.  But Airplane! is a strong second place. 
It saddens me that barely anyone has mentioned the Kentucky Fried Movie. Please do yourself a favor and watch it. 
Over Macho Grande?No, I don't think I will ever be over Macho Grande.Airplane is my #1 favourite movie period, let alone favourite comedy.  Even the sequel, while not as good, still amazing in my eyes.  Wish they would have done a final 3rd movie, as a possible goodbye to Zucker, Zucker, and Abrahams.  edit: I am also a sucker for Hot Shots 1 and 2
It's just so damn stupid and relentlessly so. I love it.
I got married earlier this year. Before the wedding, I had a list of films that my wife had to watch before I could marry her. Really just an excuse to watch a series of awesome films over the course of a week. A Few Good Men, Mad Max: Fury Road, Four Lions, In Bruges, Moon, Get Out, Twelve Angry Men, Birdcage, Primer, all hits.The only two she didn't like, and it still pains me to type it out, were GOAT comedy Airplane! and GOAT action-blockbuster Terminator 2. Had to have a long, hard think before the wedding.
Have you heard of I'm Gonna Git You Sucka?
The Golden Era of relentlessly funny movies is over. Studios interfere over their bottom line, reboots and formulaic garbage pervades the landscape. Comedy is subsidized and homogenized and fact-checked and screen-tested to idiots. The Almighty Dollar blinds progressive vision and insures tepid, vanilla enterprise. 
Have you ever seen a grown man naked?
And it looks like a big tylenol!~ most favorite character, so amazingly bitchy and Roger Smith esque
Hey, you know what they say...See a broad to get dat booty yak 'em......leg 'er down a smack 'em yak 'em!COL' got to be! Y'know? Shiiiiit.
Can't tell you how many times as a kid I rented Airplane! from Blockbuster between the years 1993 and 2000. Probably wore that VHS out.
I'm 33.I've been watching this film for about 25 years, and it still never fails to entertain me.
If you liked Airplane! You should watch the following movies:Spaceballs,Hot Shots,Hot Shots Part Deux,The Naked GunDon't bother with the second airplane movie, it's a steaming pile....
This movie gave me a drinking problem. 
It's like a batch of high quality dad jokes. I love it.
And we owe it to Police Squad for Airplane. "Who are you ? How did you get in here ?" "I'm a locksmith, I'm a locksmith"
Have you seen The Naked Gun, Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles? 
Robinhood Men in Tights is a great movie
Welcome to the 1980s. Looks like you picked the wrong week to quit smoking.TIL that Airplane! is also a near scene-for-scene remake of the 1957 serious disaster movie [Zero Hour]( http://www.slashfilm.com/lol-see-how-airplane-liberally-borrowed-from-1957-thriller-zero-hour/) .Zero Hour features a passenger plane with the crew afflicted by food poisoning, and an unwilling ex-pilot named Ted Striker who has to land the plane.  Many scenes in Airplane! copy the dialogue, lighting or framing of the same scene in Zero Hour. The Zucker Brothers even bought the rights to the movie so they wouldn't be sued.And here's the [side by side comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BjU-e01zQ4),courtesy Neatorama.
One of my favorite scenes https://youtu.be/fXSLcYQHqFQ
This and The Naked Gun are tied for first. 
I finally saw this movie when it played on my ship last deployment. Absolutely do not regret the sleep I lost to watch it. Absolutely in tears laughing from start to finish. 
The white zone" 
 I just want to tell you both good luck. We're all counting on you. 
I could say its just an okay comedy movie. 
You should watch Blazing Saddles. One of the funniest movies I've seen.
Another similar movie that you fargin bastages would like is Johnny Dangerously starring Michael Keaton.
>Apart from some scenes, they never overdid the parody part.So, they didn't never overdo the parody.
Spaceballs is as legendary as a movie parody can get. Definitely recommend that one. 
Great movie, but The Other Guys was funnier IMO. 
I will never laugh as hard as I did upon first seeing the Israeli plane in that movie having a beard.  
Top secret is also pretty good. My all time favorite though is Blazing saddles 
Then I highly recommend "Top Secret" starring Val Kilmer
Omg....watch it over and over. There are layers of humor you missed the first time. I love Airplane. It was the best!! .
Loaded weapon... Tim Curry in a girl scout uniform, need I say more.
Must be something wrong with me, I found every movie mentioned in this thread painfully unfunny. Feels crazy to be so out of step with the consensus. 
You know wha' they say: See a broad to get that bodiac lay'er down an' smack 'em yack 'em.
Ever seen Rat Race? I laughed so hard in that one, I nearly wound up in the hospital. 
I didn't really like it. Maybe another watch might change my mind? I felt the jokes were repetitive, similar, and somewhat crude. There's only so many double entendres I can take without getting bored of the gimmick.
I tried to rewatch it recently and couldn‚Äôt get through it. Yeah, there are a lot of funny jokes but for every great joke there are probably about 10 that are *terrible* and there are so many of them, it‚Äôs like a joke every five seconds. I can‚Äôt really enjoy that shotgun approach to comedy but I know this subreddit adores it. 
Honestly I have never seen another movie or TV show that has as many jokes/gags per minute as Airplane! did. I mean even when most of it is such goofy humor I end up cracking up throughout the entire movie.
You may also like "Amazon Women on the Moon".
All I remember are the boobs.  It was my first glimpse of delicious breastisis.  As a kid they were magnificent.
My husband quotes this on the daily
Great! Now watch Airplane 2: The Sequel! I find it at least equally funny!
Copy that.  We have Clearance, Clarence.Over, Unger.  What's our Vector, Victor?Roger, Roger.
Watch Police Squad! the TV show..you'll be laughing so hard.
"They could be miles off course""That's impossible, they're on instruments!"I lost it.
OK, now you have to find and watch ZERO HOUR, the straight dramatic movie that AIRPLANE is based on. From wikipedia: "[ZERO HOUR] is best known for its classic 1980 film parody, Airplane!, which uses the original screenplay almost verbatim."
Blazing saddles 2. Because someone already said blazing saddles so watch it twice.
X-post /r/iwatchedanoldmovie
Airplane got a fucking sub-8 score? Jesus, what the hell IMDB? 
Will Harris wrote a really good oral history about the making of this movie. It is a really good read.https://film.avclub.com/surely-you-can-t-be-serious-an-oral-history-of-airplan-1798279218
It‚Äôs an amazing film. My favourite scene is when everyone lines up to beat up the woman that‚Äôs freaking out. I‚Äôve seen a decent amount of goofy parody movies ever since I got into watching films but Airplane! will always be my favourite. 
The best part is when the shit hits the fan.
I promise you, if you see it 100 more times, you will see 100 more jokes that you never noticed before, it's that amazing.
I thought I'd stop reading at comment number 5... number 6... number 7... number 8... number 9... 10... 11... 12...
Ever spent time in a Turkish prison?
Another Classic is Blazing Saddles (If you‚Äôre not easily offended.)
True story, when i was a kid, i thought it was a horror movie about people getting sick on a plane.  the movie terrified me and I couldn't watch it again until I was a teenager. 
In Australia it was called "Flying High"...
[Blazing Saddles](https://youtu.be/CyfklSB6cYs?t=13)[Airplane!](https://youtu.be/YzE0w6-aPM4?t=1)[Hot Shots! Part Deux](https://youtu.be/5ryq_BR6QMw)Thanks to u/Armedes for compiling a recommended list. These are Youtube videos, so are of poor quality - sorry about that.
Try Kentucky Fried Movie
My all time favourite film. Every time I see it, I always notice something new. Glad you enjoyed it.
Murder by death (1976) - seen it so many times and still funny, if you know the old miss marple, charlie chan and sam spade movies. Give it a try, it's hilarious! 
Is it your first ZAZ ? it's a trio, Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zucker,_Abrahams_and_Zucker
"The shit's really hit the fan""Oh stewardess, I speak jive"One of the best comedies out there. 
I'm perplexed that people are ignorant of the existense of Top Secret https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKRfFEa9PGE
My fave comedy ever. You have impeccable taste.My favourite lines are likely from Johnny at airport command and the court scenes.Elaine (doe eyed) : Do you know what it's like to laugh like that?Judge (dead serious): Yes. Yes I do.
It is also empirically the funniest movie ever made. 
"How soon can you land this plane?""I can't tell you.""You can tell me, i'm a doctor""No, i mean i'm not sure.""Well, can't you take a guess?""... Not for another 2 hours.""You can't take a guess for another 2 hours?"
... That's Lt. Herwitz, , severe shell shock . Thinks he's Ethel Murman .
Surely you cant be serious. 
Seen the Naked Gun series?
This was one of the few movies that me and my parents can watch and laugh at together. It's magical.
Even during the credits:Best boy (electric)   Frank McKane,Worst Boy                  Adolf Hitler
"Oh stewardess, I speak jive."
Easily, one of the greatest comedies ever. An absolute classic
Not sure if anyone else mentioned it, but I was really pleasantly surprised by Scary Movie 3. And it's got Leslie Nielsen. 
We have clearance ClarenceRoger, RogerWhat's our vector, Victor? 
If you didn't know any better, you might assume Will Smith was the lame friend that tagged along with the popular couple on their trip to the playboy mansion.

Fresh Prince is wearing a cute skirt and Carlton is chilling in his underwear like a boss 
Curious, did Hugh wear anything other than a robe?
TIL Carltons ripped
WTF who dressed Will Smith?!
Did she ever pose?
For a brief moment Carlton was cooler... then after that fleeting moment captured here. Will went back to playing volleyball with the entirety of the playboy model catalogue. And Carlton went back to... I have no idea
Will is like "yeah, screw movin' in with my auntie and uncle in Bel-Air, I want to stay with Uncle Hef"
You know they jumped on it
Why was he the nerd? He's way more buff than will. 
fuck Karen Parsons was too fine
Socks and sandals... Come on Will.
The bookends weren‚Äôt doing bunnies.
I remember that episode, good stuff
Hillary was smoking!
Man I never knew Carlton was a Greek god 
Will shoobin' it up.
Holy shit, he does look like Bill Maher. 
Socks and sandals Will? Really?
WTF Will Smith wears white sports socks with sandals#badtaste
Everybody is talking about the socks, but what about those baseball shorts? Haha
Carlton is ripped!
All I see is socks and sandals. 
Damn dude Carlton's fucking ripped. I mean I ain't gay but if I had to had a man fuck me in the ass, he wouldn't be a bad choice.
Young Richard Dawkins in his mansion. 
Each cast member collectively keeping their distance. But can I point out how Carlton never got the credit he deserved for his body.
Too bad she never posed back then. 
Ah, nineties black guys were the best! 
When was it that Jeff decided ,"Tuck it,I'm wearing pajamas all the time!"
Big willy style.
Karyn was all jello, no toast
This is cool
Jazzy Jeff missing the cut
Need more friends like Hugh.
All I see is chicken legs
German socks and Birkenstocks...that's like trying to make the beat drop but you have chicken pox.
Carlton is ready to fuck
DO THE BUNNY HOP. AND HOP HOP HOP.
People will love anyone after they die
... and tell me one more time how white socks and flip flops aren't a thing!
Damn. That wonky dance guy was cut!
Nice of you to date it, but I think Will's clothes took care of that. 
the only reason I am saving this is to show my girlfriend Will Smith wearing sandals with socks
Carlton could have kicked Will's ass. 
Yo  home to Bel-Air!!!
YOU WEAR SOCKS AND SANDALS TO THE PLAYBOY MANSION?? 
I had such a crush on Karyn. 
Will the 90s ever come back?
Carleton is jacked.
1993 is considered old school now hm.... I feel a slight mid life crisis coming. 
Karyn Parsons is so hot. Absolute teenage crush! 
I guess Jazz got thrown out
Not just socks and sandals, but socks and *velcro* sandals. How many bunnies did he run through that night? Stuff of legends. 
socks & sandals
Is there ever a picture of Hef NOT in his PJ's?
Man... Birkenstocks and socks ??? I'm not getting jiggy with it
they had group sex, i guarantee it
man will smith is such a legend and I feel like he opened the door to being able to express yourself the way you like. Same goes for Hugh! R.I.P champ! you got a lot of bunnies in your new universe.
Karyn 
Is it too early to talk about how he more or less paid prostitutes to have unprotected sex with him, spreading diseases while living in a dilapidated mansion with filthy mattresses and dog poo everywhere?
More like old school fool. Socks and Sandals. Underwear shorts. Dork city.
Bet he didn't think he'd be dead less than 25 years later
If that was me, something would be sticking out of those boxers being that close to that hott chick
Any woman that "mourns" his death or acts like we're missing a legend...is a damn hypocrite. Y'all fight for women's rights and all this gender crap and then act like our generation just lost Sir Isaac Newton...
Scum! 
Does this happen in the wild? You think tigers just fall off shit and we never see it?

The real reason Springfield should've been in Ohio.

Springfield, OH is a shithole. Homer would be in the 1%.
I thought they were from Northern Kentucky.
Too bad there's not a political party called "annoyed grunt."
This is a joke, the caliber of which, I'd expect out of the shows writers. Sadly the running joke of their home state being a mystery probably prevented this. Great post.
This actually only works if he is a Democratic *senator* from Ohio.  If he were in the House it would say (D-OH7) or whichever district he reps)
Well done.

Sherrod Brown is Homer Simpson confirmed.
Simpsons hasn't done that, amazing.
If Scooby and Shaggy were Republicans in Utah and Ohio, they would be R-UT R-OH
I would vote for him because he works in a nuclear power plant which makes him a genius and who wouldn't want a genius to be their congressman.
Hey, Homers too ole boy to be a D, he's a Moe's tavern R without a doubt.

There's actually been a real-life [Mr. Burns (D-OH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Burns) (1857-59). Sadly, no Simpson though.

Ohioan here. As a kid before the location of Springfield was revealed, I was always certain it would be in Ohio. I remember having this exact revelation about congressman Simpson sometime around 8-9th grade, and fucking losing it. I told a friend and they didn't find it funny at all, harsh words were exchanged.  Haven't really thought about it till your post, loving the memory. Great minds think alike, also!

I tweeted this yesterday you thieving bastard 
Put this on showerthoughts bro.
So, if underwater seismic activity damages one of those Atlantic cables, does everyone lose service? Does some poor IT guy get woken up in the middle of the night, put on a boat, and dropped into the ocean to fix it?
Just imagine how much infrastructure there is that isn't publicly mapped out like this...probably so much military crap.
I remember when I first found out there were underwater cables connecting continents. I thought it was so cool because I always assumed we just used high speed satellites for worldwide communications. Then I saw this map and I was blown away how that many cables went that far across the world!
Interesting coincidence. I was looking at this very website with my students yesterday when we were discussing networking media. Unless u/yacuso is one of my students...in which case well done for paying attention.If you are ever in doubt of human engineering brilliance just consider the laying of a 9000 km fibre optic cable across the Pacific.
Most of the owners of these cables are old school telecom companies. Do any of the internet giants own any of the cables: Google, MSFT, Facebook, Amazon?
This map seems even more distorted than the standard Mercator. Seeing this on a more accurate projection, showing true length of the cables that travel around Africa would be mind-blowing.
It really messed me up when my brother told me about the underwater sea cables. Up until last year (I am 20 years old) I thought the Internet and data and stuff was just transmitted through satellites and waves. Then he told me about the sharks. 
1) live right above the cable2) add a device to said cable that would delay signals by 1ms.3) ???4) Profit!!!!
Do we have any electricity transmissiom cables that run across the ocean like this?
I always wondered if Columbus would be mad if told that a few centuries after they almost gave up and turned back before arriving to America, we put a multitude of cables connecting all the continents.
Nicely timed post, at least for me.  I just finished reading *Cryptonomicon* by Neal Stephenson two days ago. 
6 of these cables have a point less than 25 miles from me. Is there a place I can see it? I want to take a tour or something.
I'd like the map to not show landmasses at all. You should be able to deduct where everything is by the underwater cable lines 
What's the deal with cables like TAT-14, is it just a bunch of cables run at the same time, or is there something else going on?
Don't know if this was asked yet, but how deep are they, since you know, our own oceans are the final frontier and all?
What is it with this "use two fingers to move the map" silliness?Google doesn't do it, and It is almost as annoying as those "please rotate your device" messages.
a significant number of the Atlantic cables terminate about 15 miles from where i live. interesting!Long Island, if you were wondering. which you probably weren‚Äôt.
This must have been what Sherlock used to nab that dude in New York.  I watched the Dateline special all about it.  Riveting, or in this case, tunneling.
> You have exceeded your daily request quota for this API. We recommend enabling billing to get a higher quota:Mirror anyone?
So we all are connected to the internet through these wires?Can anyone explain how does all the data pass through this and then gets distributed to the individual? I mean how does the information so big transfers through these wires without getting it messed up?
Who pays for the installation and upkeep of these cables.I pay my internet provider for internet access, does some of that money go towards the people who own these cables? And if so how does it get distributed. I probably connect to an American server everyday but maybe a Japanese server once a month?
I love how you can keep scrolling to one side and the map wraps back around. It's a small thing, but it made me happy.
Would be nice if there was a map which showed exactly where the cables went from, right now it seems like just ease of use.I want to know this so I can measure what would be the fastest route to somewhere, using the cables, then again if there is issues with the hops it might not be the fastest anyway, but still.
seems like a very high % of the transatlantic cables terminate in the UK, presumably for historic or geographical reasons. Have the rest of Europe ever considered this a security risk?
UX wise it would be nice if the locations had a hover with data, now I have to click first to see where the dot is
All lies.  My ISP in Taiwan would have me believe there's only one and it's the reason they have such crappy service.  Couldn't be because they're a crappy  company, could it? 
And the ones that come to Vietnam keep getting "damaged" often by "sharks".Internet sucks here, especially on the island I'm on. 
Is this a map or a "map" like subway maps that show connectivity and play fast and loose with actual geography between endpoints?
There is a new cable being built from Sopela (Bilbao, Spain) to Virginia Beach (USA). It is scheduled to finish this fall, and Microsoft, Facebook and Telefonica (a Spanish telephone/internet provider) are behind it.Here is the article in Spanish:https://www.google.es/amp/s/elpais.com/economia/2017/06/13/actualidad/1497343785_136951.amp.html

To be fair to Lewis he's right, on each of those specific dates they are the best crowds anywhere in F1. 
He did say the best crowd **here**, so he means compared to all other crowds that were ever in Malaysia.
yeah it's a bit bullshitty to say it every single time but on the other hand, he does seem to really appreciate all the people coming out to the track, and it looks like everyone is having a good time. As long as it's like that, I don't mind it personally.
i mean what should he say? *crowd is really good here, not as good as in canada tho*
HowToLewisReporter: *asks a question about Lewis' top notch performance*Lewis: **Well, first of all take a look at this crowd (etc.)**
He now talked about the best crowd there, which is a first that he talks about it compared to previous years
I remember him one time (Italy, maybe?) saying the track was amazing and the car was amazing but without referring to the crowd.
This is perfect Monday material.
This sub is so dense. What he actually said: "this is the best crowd I've ever seen HERE" and he prefaced that by mentioning that it's the last race in Malaysia. He very clearly attributed it to it being the last race.Carry-on with the herd mentality
Who let drunk Johnny Herbert do the post qualifying interviews today? That was insane. 
I don't know why this makes me laugh so much. Needs a video compilation.
Obviously it‚Äôs the same fans going to each race, so it‚Äôs always the best ones. Pfft, I thought everyone knew this OP...
I can not believe people take him literally. It is called hyperbole. 
What else should he say? "Look at this crowd! They are not as good as Silverstone.... or Spain... Or Spa. But still great!"
That took me longer than it should...
upcoming race: "Suzuka is such a special place the crowd is always amazing we have such great support here"
/r/f1circlejerk worthy... but kinda true. I guess.
Honest man. 
Best fans are in London though....wait
<chuckles> Good shiiiit.
Well not Italy this year that's for sure.
We are so lucky that Son accepts that impact sub role and doesn't demand starts every week. 
Why is Lewis also always so concerned about his appearance, always with his back to the camera, never taking his helmet of before his PA lady is with him to hand him his cap, never showing his hair, is he that self aware what people think of him, he has just driven a F1 car, you are allowed to be sweaty :).Besides that he is a tremendous driver and cant wait for him to really battle with the youngsters.edit: why the downvotes, no hard feelings against Lewis, I just find it wierd.
Everyone's the best crowd in F1
Wow, what a great audience.
Made it to the front page lol
Best commenters I've seen here ever! What fantastic!
You guys rock harder than Shelbeyville 
I cringe every time he says this when you actually know that he really doesnt mean it.
"every time we come out here we have the best fans"

Abu Dhabi is my city. Wait, that‚Äôs actually correct
I don't know what I expected but it wasn't that 
At every step I tried guessing what the hell was going on but ended up just yelling WTF instead... Weirdly enough what I find the most unexpected about this video was how appealing and delicious she managed to make the crepe look
https://imgur.com/ivn3GXC.gifv
When she broke out the eggs, I fully expected this to go full-on HowToBasic.
I'm just thinking of how food safe those tower materials are...
My thoughts while watching this video. *Big deal I know how to unplug and replu- oh...**Oh using wood fire to clean the case? Oh... She's using that shit to grill...**Oh wow, it still works... Huh, how about that?*
I have a feeling this is frowned upon in the office space. 
When you feel like being just a bit extra for lunch. 
As an IT person, I was mostly annoyed at the fucking space heater on the same circuit as the computers. Stop that shit, users!
I don't know why I'm so angry at you for making me watch that OP... twice
I'm fairly certain it's not OK to heat up that paint, cook on it, and then eat from it ...
When it's got a built-in breakfast processing unit 
Great way to end up with toxic chemicals in your food. 
I took a while to get stupid, but, when it did, it got real stupid.
I've never felt more robbed of time 
If you guys don't know this is Ms Yeah, a YouTuber who does this kinda stuff.  I don't know how you guys don't know her, but her vids are pretty creative, but I don't really know if it's safe
I can't believe I watched the whole thing. 
She also does a hot pot with the office water cooler.https://youtu.be/Pg7a2M2V87g
That was the strangest unboxing video I've ever seen...
r/diwhy
Considering the PC frame and paints involved in her cooking process, that's freaking toxic as hell
You know, now I want a TV show where one of the background characters, who never says a single word, does things like this behind the main characters.Nobody pays attention, nobody comments on it, and it happens every episode.
Best part of the whole thing is when the other girl steals her chips as she's eating 
That gif twisted and turned like a twisty turny thing.
Every single cut had me wondering where this was going. This is the peak of /r/Unexpected, I think.I would without a doubt marry that woman just on this video. Holy shit.
Yeah, you're not allowed in the computer lab anymore.
This is really cool, and if you do this to my computer *I will fucking kill you.*
Wow and I'm 10/10 certain that finish / paint / shit on the side of that case is not supposed to be heated with fire and then ingested. I feel like naming those anything but Fresh Cancer Wraps (with egg) is a misnomer.
you could pretty much achieve the same amount of heat with a R9 290X
[Sauce](https://youtu.be/WZSM9Ga1X5c)
Why didn't she just use that heat lamp?
What did she make? 
WHY ISN'T SHE PERFORMING ESD COMPLIANT PROCEDURES
Holy crepe!
When you take the concept of "acceptable time spent doing lunch during work hours" and then utterly crush it....although I guess if her lunch time is unpaid anyways, then it should be okay as long as she fulfills her required amount of work hours during the rest of the day.
I was hoping to see her cable management. 
She's also made a steak https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cR4dl2zppo
This girl knows how to get cancer.
Crosspost this to /r/pcmasterrace
Really cool.
I love how her co-worker slid the bag of chips closer to her when the other lady was eating her crepe
This is the most non-PC post I've ever seen. And I'm somehow scared, aroused, and hungry all at the same time.
What the fuck did I just watch
It‚Äôs not stupid if it works
That may have been one of the most unusual gifs I've ever seen 
Working in IT support, I am convinced that this happens at my work on a regular basis. It would explain so many of my tickets.
mmm id totally eat that cancer-causing pc tower jian bing
She didn't even ground herself. 
I can't imagine that metal is safe. No no one manufactures a computer case and goes "if I heated this with fire and soaked food on top of it over an extended period of time, will it leach any harmful metals or chemicals into that food?"
She could've skipped straight to the cooking part if it was an AMD rig
That might have been the biggest waste of time of my life.
I have hard time just bending down and plugging a usb. 
I wish that gif was longer. 
At first i thought it was going to be a sleeper build
I figured she was gonna steal the mobo

Why....
Pffft wood fire, could just throw in a Radeon HD 6990. Same effect.
This is why I choose pc over mac
not the first to do this but i really cant imagine cooking on something painted can be good for you.... 
this is shameless? why not just link to her video on youtube so she gets credit and views? https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRB4xZ_2ew7fzmrcv8aj4Lw
Chinese do not joke around food, we are the Hobbits of the Earth.
That escalated too well, my mouth couldn't handle
Man, at my office they got mad the time I microwaved leftover Tikka Masala.
Welp that got weird fast. 
Brilliant!
This is the best thing ever
I want a job where my lunch break is that long! 
That was a wild ride from start to finish
I mean that as a whole was a series of unexpected events. I would even go as far as to say it was one of the most unexpected things I've ever seen. 
Could you imagine the chemicals burned off of that PC case...
/r/GifsThatKeepOnGiving
Please marry me
Didn't know that MacGyver had a daughter
As a poor man who has a good PC but can't afford a new one if it breaks, this video gave me a heart attack.
This girl was recently interviewed on NPR.  She's one of China's famous social media celebrities where she posts short videos of her cooking at her desk.
I‚Äôm in love
That bitch at the end stole her chips

/u/dhavalpatel93am so high rn 
It's late and I've had a few beers, so please forgive me if it's obvious, but why did she jump some pins in the power supply connector? At what point was that used?**EDIT:** just watched a 3rd time. It looks like she activated the fan on the PS to help give the fire oxygen???
First I was like umm...Then I was likeyumm...then I was all Hmm...
No need to disassemble everything. Just get a r9 fury.
Why?
Ummmmmm wtf? ... Asians <3 ... but really that paint can't be good for you, or that paint on the wood used for fire. But whatever lol this is awesome 
PC = Personal Chef
The fuck
I can't remember the last post that was so well suited to the sub it was on
Oh great, another unrealistic relationship goal to add to my list.
wtf did I just watch
I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't that...
Dude. What.
I guess this would work if one did not have some sort of a kitchen 
Seems like a lot of work, and I only get a 30 minute lunch break, so I‚Äôd get my computer a part and have to go back to work 
I just...  I mean... 
I want the time from my life that was wasted watching that, sent back to me. 
plus what she makes looks really good
This was the most unnecessary thing I saw this week
Got work, make lunch for 7 hours, go home. I love my job.
There's potato chips in her burrito. 
But why?
God damnit, Amy! Every fucking day!
I mean, bonus is you always have a clean computer case.
so much work - and my time - for something as unfunny as this
r/gifsthatkeepongiving
that was lit
I'm hungry now
That is some straight MacGyver shit
Such a stupid waste of time.
that's.... what?
I love that someone thought of this. Humans are awesome again.
Definitely unexpected 
What is up with that glowing fan?
I love these videos there's another one where the same girl makes steam buns at her desk, I looked up the link to post it here now I'll be watching every video on their channel I didn't know about https://youtu.be/w6bN-2NSu74
Could've just put an i9 in it, would've saved time. 
This idea for this video probably sounded a lot better on paper.
Rip. Still saving up for a pc to game on and this girl just casually cooks some food on it.
Seriously the stupid thing I have ever seen. 
$user: Hi, tendy_trux35 ? Yeah for some reason my computer won't start.$me : Have you tried rebooting it? $user : ummm...well not really. I think the computer is fried.$me: Dammit Becky, there's literally a fried egg inside your computer. How do you explain that?$user : well I saw this video and I was hungry
To think, this is how we had to cook before 1+ GHz reference video cards were invented...
This is why her lunch break is 4 hours long. 
man, the toxin from the computer case must be nice
Try to do that with an ipad!
she is thee dream of sum yung guy.
Ummm. Chinese food mixed with toxic chemicals coming off of that powder coated surface. Sign me up!
Is that the $5 fan from Linus Tech Tips recent video?
Rip her not being grounded
When your job decides microwaves and stoves are firehazards and your tired of eating sandwiches everyday.
I think Linus Tech Tips did this build, too.
WRF
Still better than microwaving fish at the office.
Is this compatible with windows 10?
that made me exhausted just watching it. 
What, why?
Ok.
I don't get why she wired up the PC fan - to make the fire in the bowl burn hotter? 
That is talent
It's like PC bang meets mukbang 
But can she cook Crysis?
When you don‚Äôt have a stove at home 
I feel like there's a better way to make lunch...

She could have just used the side and the heat dish.... 
First half of vid reminded me how I need to pull out the extra ram and motherboard before they swap out my work PC. One can only deal with a 1998 win nt pc for so long
I saw this on daily mail and all I could think of was how fucking fast she would be fired for damaging company property. I'm only 31 but I feel old
Nice.
Could've just used regular Skylake-X chips to save effort

Honestly this was pure art 
That... that is damn impressive.
This is first class murder
I love watching her videos! If there is ever an apocalypse I want her on my team! 
This gave me hives.
Half expected her to pop a GTX 580 in there and use it to cook the meal.
Or she couldve just used the from the computer?
My thoughts exactly:"Oh it's a gaming cafe. Oh, she's putting in her own video card or something. The motherboard is out? Weird. Wait.. why is she lighting it on fire? Am I watching a cooking YouTube channel? Draw the rest of the fucking owl? What? What? Computer again!"
"Stove companies hate her, how one simple hack can save you thousands in appliances"
Jesus that was a journey
What the fuck did I just watch.
... What is the thought process for this? I really want to know why this happened the first time, how it continued, and why everyone she works with has gotten used to it. This is so weird..
Oh god static 
I thought she was gonna climb in and fold up like a contortionist so I don't know how I feel right now
Pointless question, but why the paperclip in the Power Supply? I'm stumped on that....
I kind of want to try cooking whatever it is she made. It looked delicious.
Even as unexpected as this is, it's not interesting in the slightest, so why was this upvoted?A) because it's a girlB) because it's an asian girl. You weebs are pretty predictable, which makes this  /r/expected, while being relevant to /r/unexpected

Best use of an Acer I've seen yet.
Except now she has to buy the PC so what your looking at is just a $9 meal + $200 PC that you can't eat but have to buy because you used it for a stove. Most people would of read the damage fees and most do.
This is some Aperture Science type home cooking here!
Y tho
The food she made with the flat dough and egg is called a "jian bing". They're available in street carts usually near post offices or busy intersections around breakfast time and they're damn good. Source: lived in Beijing for 6 weeks and Baotou for two years and ate a lot of jian bings. 
I honestly got tired for her just at the moment she begun to move the pc. 
Growing up in Beijing I used to love eating those breakfast cakes on the streets but my parents always told me not to cus fear of health hazards.  Now while in NA the only chance to get them is when I go back to NYC to visit my ma and aunt.  Fuck those were delicious if made right.

A silly joke but i like it.

Bet you scrolled back up to see whether Thai was in the list.
"A Scottish"
I'm surprised you included Taiwan
My girlfriend did not enjoy me reading this joke out loud for her. 
No Englishman, and a Scottish??? It's a Scotsman.Also, I just noticed you've put "a Brit".Nice joke, bad execution.
Lol what a nice touch to add "a Waldo," in there!

I think you could tell this joke with just a little change! (hear me out) just use only the 10 Southeast Asian countries. People will get the idea. 
I was happy and excited for a moment when I thought the joke is about an Algerian
I love the implied tl;dr. Like cmon who actually read this and yet we all got the punchline
The only part if this joke that bothers me is "a Scottish". That is not how you refer to us (it's not offensive or anything it just sounds weird). You refer to someone from Scotland as "a Scotsman" or if you want to be gender-neutral about it "a Scot". Scottish isn't used as an adjective for people unless you were saying something like "a Scottish person"  but even then you'd always include "person". I'm sure there's others like that here but that one jumped out at me. Never in my life has someone referred to me as "a Scottish" and if they did I'd assume English wasn't their first language.Nitpicking aside: good one, though most versions I hear usually just go with 3 or 4 nationalities.
>a Brit>a Scottish>a WelshWHAAAAAAAT ISSSSSSS THISSSSSSSSSS
Excuse me a Turkish????? Thats TURK to u sir thank u very much üò°

Oh, but a missing Montenegrin is fine?
South Sudan? Or East Timor?
GIVE THIS GUY GOLD NOW
>a Trinidadian or Tobagonian"Trinidadian" works just fine...
I'm that guy1. A Taiwanese person is still Chinese. 2. Turkish is the adjective, Turk is the noun. A turk = a Turkish person. The same reason that a Spaniard is a Spanish person.
"A Scottish" Fucking really pal
i like your personal take on ol' #763
The whole WORLD walks in to a pub. The first guy in says 'I'll get the drinks in'. 
Bcz the owner was a thai
I'm lost, they do have a Thai, it saw a Taiwanese... 
I don't understand. If all these guys are missing a thigh, how did they get to the club? Assuming that the joke hinges on a pun of Thai.
Where the fuck is the cornish in this joke?No one recognizes us :C
I believe you misspelled Nigerian as nigerien 
Nice repost ya got there.
Terrible. You included so many nationalities that by the time I got through the A countries, I no longer wanted to read and skipped right to the end.A swing and a miss.
Armenians don't exist 
.. how come African wasn't invited?.This joke is racist..!
Needs a tldr
Okay, but where‚Äôs the punchline? The pun?
someone said Venezuela ?
It would be a much better joke without the terrible "Thai" pun, a better nationality for the end would be a completely random one such as an Uzbek or a Rwandan.
At 1.50 with a drink and a refill? Yeah, I'll stay inside the store and spend more money.
Considering there are 727 Costcos that are open over 350 days per year, and there are only 32 baseball parks that each host 81 games a year, that isn't really a surprising statistic.
If baseball stadiums sold me a hot dog and a soda for $1.50 I'd purchase them more at games
My local Costco would sell a billion more hotdogs if they actually had more seating in the food area. I'm tired of eating my hot dogs standing next to the garbage bins. 
Well a hotdog combo at a stadium cost about 10.00 at Costco 1.50 I think the stadiums are winning 
Let‚Äôs pour out a little refillable soda for the chicken bakes and the pizza. 
Definitely helps that they're 5x tastier but 1/5th the price!
They're $1.50, taste delicious, come with a ton of condiment options, and you get a soda WITH a free refill. WTF did you expect?
My understanding is that the food court also consistently loses Costco money, but they keep it open as a service to members (I assume they justify it financially as marketing/advertising).
That's enough hot dogs for every third person in America to be slapped in the face with a weiner.
The Costco food court is such a melting pot of American culture. Poor people coming for the hotdogs and pop. Rich people stopping in after dropping a $5,000 on a 6 pack of T.V's. All living in harmony just enjoying some hotdogs and pop. 
I know people who go to Costco by AT&T Park before a game to get hot dogs. Getting five hot dogs for less than $10 there is better than paying $70 to feed the family at the park. 
It's an impressive stat, until you find out that the number one place to serve weiners is still your mom's bedroom.
Welcome to Costco, I love you.
That's because hot dogs aren't $7 a piece at Costco.
I just ordered Taco Bell and now I want a hotdog. Asshole. 
What is the Ikea hotdog stat?
In 2 weeks I will have worked at Costco for 10 years.I've never had a Costco hot dog.Edit: calm the pitchforks. I'm not a bad person, hah, I have just never liked hot dogs. And it's like our biggest staple. It's my weird fact about myself.
There are a lot more costcos than baseball stadiums. Each Costco is also open more days per year, and sell necessities instead of itself being a luxury.This is a silly comparison.
I read this to my dad. In his best Jennifer Coolidge Impersonation he said "Makes me want a hot dog real bad." 
/r/HailCorporate
1.50 for a decent hot dog and a Coke vs 16 bucks for a crappy hot dog and a small drink that's packed with ice. I'll take Costco. Edit. Fixed the price per dog.
Don't like hot dogs in general but I did get their cheezzzyyyyy pizza fresh out of the oven last time I went.  YUM it was sooooooo good.
I WILL TELL YOU WHYIf you are a traveling hobo it is the cheapest meal you can find.so if you plan to backpack around and travel for awhile... remember that.
That's because they are $1.50 not 10 bucks
You could get 10 Costco dogs and 10 drinks for the price of one od each at a MLB game. Freakin' ridiculous.
Heh, ok so if soda / food / popcorn actually cost a reasonable price, I would buy it every. single. time. at movie theaters ($8 for a SMALL popcorn) & sporting events. But because I know its going to cost me an arm and a leg (someone send me that 'IT' gif please), I don't spend my money there and just eat before I go to a movie or sports event @ a place that actually tastes good.I know those shitty nachos are fun to eat in the park, tho. But, most parks are upping their game & providing good food (still way too expensive for $8 corn). I think it was the Falcons owner who did away with the stupid prices & well, lets see how the volume goes up against the pricing. He might be onto something.
Because they're a DOLLAR FIDDY
Useless factoid, how many hours/days is Costco open vs Baseball park?
My grandfather made a habit of going to Costco every Wednesday and getting a hotdog. He did this for years and made friends with the employees and other regular customers. When he passed away the manager of the Costco came and put a hotdog (wrapped in foil) in the casket with him at the wake. I know it seems cheesy, but it was pretty moving gesture knowing that my grandfather had made an impact on the store like that. 
I so want Costco to buy the naming rights for my team's park. Can you imagine the marketing impact of $1.50 dog and a soda at the ballbark?
To bad they had to mess with the berry smoothie though.
hotdog + drink 1.50slice of pizza 1.50obesity = priceless. 
Wait. You're seriously telling me we have a National Hot Dog & Sausage Council? What in the actual fuck?
AMA Request: Someone who's eaten a CostCo hot dog
At a small fraction of the price too
They're better than the ones you get at the baseball games. 
Costco also have great poutine
Ay them polish dogs are good
MLB sells them for $5 each. No shit they won‚Äôt match that. 
I don't know how they taste in the States, but in Canada they are SO DELICIOUS.
And they haven't raised their hotdog prices in years. Same with the rotisserie chicken 
It's all about the bulgogi bake for me. 
Would it also be a TIL if I told you that here in Korea, Koreans just eat plates of the onions with honey mustard sauce, instead of putting it on hotdogs?
That's because costco hotdogs are fucking yummy and dirt cheap.
Also almost all Costcos let you buy food without a membership. Also in *many* states (not all) you can use the pharmacy if you don't have a membership and save a shit ton of money if you don't have insurance 
Welcome to Costco. I love you.
Every time I go to Costco I can't get over the cost of the food court. With that being said if you haven't tried the Very Berry Sundae then do it!
I think it's because a hotdog is so cheap at costco, liek 1.50 vs 9.00$ or more
And they would sell even more if they would offer chili dogs like Sam's Club.  Hell where Sam's Club especially goes wrong is they only offer hot dogs INSIDE the store (whereas Costco does it outside) meaning you have to be an actual member to buy a hot dog from Sam's but not Coscto (which means they sell even more).  Not sure why Sam's does this.
I was there when they 1st started selling hotdogs.  It was a hit right from the start, foot long hotdog and soda for $1.65 (IIRC), hard to beat that.  Us employees used to eat them all the time, then came pizza and that chicken bake.I'd much rather have a grilled hotdog, but at the price, it's hard to complain.
Price points matter here.
I always take the wife there for a nice date night. 
They are so hilariously cheap that I end up buying some, especially on a busy day of errands.   Nobody sells hot dogs at that price.  And they taste good.  Which is just a wonderful convenience. 
Not surprising.  Costco food court food is actually really good for the price.  Their pizza is great, and only a few bucks for a pretty  big slice.
Because, unlike MLB dogs, they are tasty and reasonably priced.
Costco's Food Court is AMAZING and Cheap by the Way with many options.My favorite is the Costco Pizza in the Food Court :)
I just have to ask. Has anyone ever had both of these things and not thought a Costco hotdog is utterly superior?
To be fair, a hotdog in  Costco is like $2, whereas it's like $10 at MLB.
The onion grinder erases hotdog guilt with each crank.
Costco actually bought a hot dog manufacturer and sells them at a loss just to keep up the tradition of the $1.50 hotdog and drink special. 
Well duh, there are probably way more costco stores then baseball stadiums (30) and not to mention Costco is open more then 82 days a year...Also 1.50
$1.50 hotdogs are nice, but the endless free samples that usually make up my dinner the days prior to payday are better. 
They're good hot dogs, but they give me heartburn.
You can buy those delicious hot dogs and everything else they sell at the food court without being a member.  Their frozen yogurt is also very good.
And the quality of the dog is not only better tasting but at a $1.50 with a soda! Home run.
Now if only they had enough benches and tables to sit down while eating that hot dog.
CostoCo hotdogs are the best cheap lunch around.
Ha! Going there tomorrow and will probably have lunch there.  It's just so much easier.  Get all the shit you need and then feed the family for under $10.  The Chicken bake must have heroine in them.
They're $1.53. And there's one 1/2 a mile from my house. I go there daily. 
It's a fantastic deal. $1.50 for a hot dog with a pop and a free refill. Fuck yeah.
To be fair they are delicious
If baseball stadiums started selling high quality hot dogs and a soda for $1.50 I bet they'd have no issue outselling them. Instead it's $8 for a hotdog and $4 for a soda. $9 for a crappy beer if you'd prefer that. It's highway robbery 
Maybe ball parks should sell them for $1.50 including a soda. 
Ya it's because they are fucking delish 
My mom and step dad watched someone choke on a hotdog and die in a sams club. 
Have you heard about costco kimchi??? Look that shit up bitchessss!
costco food courts and 1 hr photo usually operates at a lost. 
Difference being the average person can actually afford (multiple) Costco food court hot dogs. 
Well they cost $1 at costco and about $7 at a park so...
This is the least surprising measurement for reference  ever used in TIL. 
God, they are good
Yet the ballpark hotdog revenues exceed Costco's by a trillion dollars.
because baseball hotdogs cost like 10 bucks and costco is like a buck 50?
that's a lot of weiners
Luckily baseball stadiums sell them for 6 times the price, so they still win.  GG costco!
[Just to get you in the door to buy a big ole TV.](https://www.foodbeast.com/news/costco-rotisserie-chicken/) 
I think someone is cooking the books. Money laundering 101: fluff the hotdogs Sounds like office space 2 is in the works.
Costco Kirkland beef dinner Franks are the fucking best. 
Oh this is why I saw the ad for coke and Pepsi 
They do make some pretty excellent dogs I never miss the chance to nab one of those $2 suckers each time I go there.
Sour krout plus a metric fuck ton of spicy mustard. Fuck, those hot dogs are good. 
Why would that stat be impressive? Stadiums have way fewer locations, they're open for a way shorter time, and not even every day.
Those hotdogs are boooooomb
I'm going to guess Costco is selling theirs at a reasonable price
Crazy since it seems like (as an non-baseball fan) baseball lasts 11 months per year. And 140 of the 160 games per regular season dont matter at all.
Fuck your site if you block me for using adblock.  I will never whitelist your site if you do this.
They're cheap and big.
They're probably cheaper at Costco than at the ballpark, as well.
i eat at least 2 of those every single day got 3 packages in the freezer at all times 
Probably because they charge $1.50 not $15.00.
if they sold costco hot dogs at ball games, I'd buy more
1000 hot dogs = 1 pig
I've never tasted Costco food and i feel like i'm really missing out.
That‚Äôs because Costco doesn‚Äôt try to rape you for a dog and a drink.
Even after impulse buys, Costco is STILL less expensive than a ball game(including a bottle of Cazedores) so this comes as no surprise.
On a couple occasions, a friend of mine has hosted superbowl parties at his house. He goes to Costco with a huge backpack beforehand and picks up like 40 of these badboys. So you could say me and my friends have boosted the numbers a bit.
Not to mention there's two shittons of other food at ball parks now
and they're AMAZING! Costco dogs FTW
They probably taste better too AMIRITE?!
Now if they would just go right ahead and open one in my town I could help them up that number a little. 
And they probably come drizzled with ketchup. Behold, the true horror of the cosmos.
I find this fact surprising because I use to work at Costco and never saw many hot dogs being sold... I had been shopping at Costco for many years prior and still not enough hot dogs seen.
Reasonable. Prices.
Thanks for the commercial OP.
Ya, cause Costco dogs aren't 89 dollars a pop!
This is a dumb stat
Aren't they also way cheaper at Costco
colon cancer, colon cancer everywhere
Probably helps that they're basically free and include a fountain drink. After blowing 100-500 bucks at Costco that meal price is the easiest decision ever.
A buck fifty for the best polish dog ever something I hope they never change
I'm confused as to why this is impressive. More locations, more hours, cheaper product, I don't have to spend 78 dollars just to pay 12 for a fucking 75 cent hotdog.
I really expected the last part to just be him waving enthusiastically again.
What is the file type shit! I can't even share this picture without it downloading

S... Source?
Mmmm Bailey fucking Jay. I love her
One of my proudest faps...
For maximum entertainment, sort by contraversial
How do u save this as a gif??
I'm gonna need the reactions to switch place please
Bailey Jay! Hell yeah!
The girl is Bailey Jay, a pretty famous trans porn star. Also briefly known as Harley Quinn and was known online as Line Trap before she got into mainstream porn.Definitely in my top five favorite pornstars. 
I have to say it's sad, both the response from people in the trans community and the responses to them. You have to learn to take a joke and if that joke offends someone you've got to learn to apologize man. Like no one is targeting anyone with this, I don't picture the person in this gif when I think of all the lovely people I know in the trans community and I doubt most others do, so stop giving them a reason to.
...well, I guess I'm into that now.
Oh man, the amount of triggering going on in this thread.
Does anyone have source of the non Forrest Gump part of this gif
reverse the gif and this is meirl.Someone reverse the gif please.
How is this gif being extrapolated and interpreted in such an extreme way? It shows nothing more than a presumably straight guy being attracted to someone he initially believed to be female. Upon learning that the female is in fact a trans ~~male~~ with a penis, he backs away realizing that person is not what he thought. It's a damn joke. People need to stop being so easily triggered. I saw no hint of hate towards trans people. There are actual problems and struggles you need to deal with rather than some frivolous gif on the internet.**Edit:** ~~male~~ to prevent further triggering. What is gender anyway? Genitals apparently play no role in whether or not you should be attracted to someone. It matters so little that nobody ever gets offended when you assume their gender, if they even have one.**Edit 2: Electric Boogaloo:** What I find ironic is the part of the gif containing a trans with a surprise reveal. Without having seen the source, I'm gonna assume it's supposed to get an "aha gotcha" reaction. So the trans community is offended by a normal reaction to an unexpected penis instead of Bailey Jay for seeking a reaction for her surprise penis. Am I getting this right?
I would do horrible, awful things just to get a night with Bailey Jay. 
Oh Bailey J...Still confusing those that have not seen the unseen
Oooh hell to tha naaa naaa
Best combined gif. Better than the IT one few days ago
Traps are gay
the downvoted comments is where youll find the cringe... its a joke people, chill out. if you cant laugh at yourself then you cant laugh at anyone else.
Traps aren't gay 
Sauce? I need research for uh friend.
Oh look the video isn't loading. Can we ban v.redd.it from being posted?
It's treason, then.
So much butthurt at the bottom of this thread
definitely scarier than pennywise
When you gotta act like you never seen her before and upvote it in shame
I need holy water for my eyes
I'd tap it.
Man, thank that guy who made the Gump section for the IT gif. It's gonna be so versatile. 
Life is like a box of trannies. You always find a few dicks in the crowd.
Can't even open this on mobile. Good job reddit
I don't know why this hasn't broken the Internet yet! 
I wouldn't have liked this gif but the fact that him acting played in reverse at the end works so goddamn well i just had to upvote
A little Shanghai surprise
Laughed way longer than expected. Well done. 
Ok, I actually lol'dTake your damn upvote OP. 
But really, are traps gay?
You absolute genius,this is fantastic 
Simply genius 
Anybody have the sauce for the video? Yes, my friend wants it. 
I hate myself for hating that I'm into this...
What do you have against trans porn? /r/tgirls is awesome
Lol
Man I haven‚Äôt seen Line Trap in forever. 
The "humor" here is that "finding out" that an attractive woman is an attractive transwoman is disgusting. Nah, not really funny.

Bailey jay is a fatass now, just a TIL. Still worth a fap tho.
I don't think I've ever laughed that hard at anything on Reddit. Holy shit.

And this is why you never eat Mexican food before you go to bed.
The old man is clearly disgusted. This is a good one!

Henry was also pretty pissed about how the good looking waiter kept calling her *Se√±orita* and winking all evening.
I feel teased...I want $2 Mevican AYCE buffet
His wife looks to comfortable on her pillow, she must have lost her sense of smell.
Reminds me of my first week living in my first college dorm room. Lived in a small room with another roommate. I ate something that made my asshole just as annoying as OP's mom begging for more Mexican food portions. While we were trying to go to sleep, I kept just ripping it one after another. Think of my asshole being an A-10 30mm cannon to my roommate. Maybe after 15 minutes, the room's oxygen supply was composed of farts. Roommate was trying to be nice as possible and I felt a little guilty. The issue got solved when I went to the toilet and spent 50 minutes forcing my shit out.  Hopefully after 5 years, he forgave me. Sorry Dan. 
This is the best one I have seen of these !
That's how I always felt after $1 Chinese food.
I don't care what happens to me, 2 dollars all-you-cat-eat mexican food?I wouldn't even think about it.I wouldn't even question it.I would be chowing down before the last word of the sentence "2 dollar all-you-can-eat mexican food" left your mouth.
Raise the flag, raise the flag, you‚Äôre ready for a little more Panchos Mexican buffet! 
Hey I actually know that actor! His name is Russ Bannister! He actually was one of my teachers aids in high school. 
Well done, well done 
I love this sub it's so much fun
Who sleeps with their glasses on?
Omg this made me laugh more than anything has for a long time.
Oh lord, I can smell it from here. 
Alright this might be the best post ive seen in this subreddit
I find most of these to be terribly unfunny. I only subscribed out of pity. With that being said, this one is top notch!
There was a Kitchen Nightmares episode where an Mexican Restaurant had a small trash can 90% filled with beans in the cooler  that they were feeding to customers. That is the type of place that would serve $2 all you can eat.
Man I swear I've never laughed so hard from one of these posts. This is my favorite one. 
All I have to do is breathe and I get gas. I'm a gassy person. IBS contributes but don't tell my kids because they think I'm a magic farting machine. In all seriousness though my husband quit saying anything. He just looks at me with that "Dear God it's like you rolled around raw hamburger through rotten eggs, then swirled it with rancid milk and soy sauce". I just laugh and threaten to point my butt at him next time.
I'm not *that* old

There is a decent chance that both are electric
How is the Tesla revolutionary? Fully Electric cars have been around for a long time.
Sometimes I just wish I could go back in time and blow people's mind with a picture like this. Or even a picture tbh.
A Tesla is hardly revolutionary. The model T on the other hand was the first assembly line made vehicle which paved the way for how modern vehicles are made and also paved the way for factories as well in other industries
So close no matter how far. 
Now crash them into each other so we can see how far along safety has come! 
Funny. Ford is younger than Tesla.
Were these two cars comparably priced for their time? Any economists here? 
From different millenniums...
And the Black one doesn‚Äòt need any Updates! 
tesla is a cult
Guess witch one costs less co2 to make.....
it's so exciting watching elon's companies. it's like all of apple's successes back to back all over again. constantly pushing it except at a much faster rate and from an engineering standpoint, 100 times more difficult.
Do you smell your own farts?

My brother drove a classic car to Holland a few weeks ago. He sent me this:https://imgur.com/gallery/EcB8r
Tesla owners make me chuckle.
Nice neighbourhood.    Where can I find a neighbourhood like that?
If you ever have the opportunity to ride in or drive a T, I highly suggest it, they are an amazing experience. Honestly  look up a local model T club they are all over the  place. Almost all owners love sharing them, so it won't be hard to get a ride. - car enthusiast, tesla enthusiast, former model T owner
All hail Lord Musk. We are not worthy of such revolutionary stuff.
Negalive. Electronic call is much much older. Petronazia ban this idea whit electronic car. Sad
Strip a modern ICEV of the fancy bodywork and it basically looks the same as the Model T. They really haven't moved on that far. The Model S is such a different beast under the skin.
What happens aboard ship during a storm or heavy seas. Can medical procedures still be conducted? 
Being a hospital ship, you're obviously not playing an offensive role in a war zone. However, is there any situation besides pure self defense that you are allowed to intervene in force? In short, what is your ROE? Also, would you only provide help for friendly forces, or have there been instances of injuried enemies being treated aboard?
As a sailor myself (albeit a VERY different kind) my question is more about the technical aspects than the logistical or emotional. What provides the ship's electrical power? I'm guessing a diesel generator of some kind? Hypothetically, were the diesel to fail or run out of fuel, how long could you continue to perform the ship's mission? Also, is there any surplus power? I can imagine being able to patch the ship into a damaged power grid to bring existing shore facilities back online being a huge boon in disaster relief. 
What is the ratio of time between being actively deployed helping somewhere, and just being in port?   Have there been times when the ship was needed in two or more places at once?   What does the crew do when not deployed?
Thanks for the AMA!When I was in college pursuing a nursing degree, I spoke with a Navy recruiter because I was extremely interested in working on the Mercy ships. At the time, I was told that it was the Red Cross that staffed it and it was a huge time and financial investment if I were to volunteer my time. He also told me they weren't recruiting women for nursing and only wanted them for non traditional jobs.I guess my question is, is there any truth to either of those things? 
If the ship is generally always ready, why did it take 10 days to deploy after Hurricane Maria?
Can your ship transit the Panama Canal or will you have to go long way round if required in the Atlantic?
What did you eat during your last proper meal ?  I just made mashed potatoes to eat with left over steak and meatloaf.  Do you know Morse code? when was the last time you had to use it ?  What is your favourite meal that the mess hall makes regularly ? 
Thanks for all you do. Not sure if you would know the answer, but  two questions:1) How do most of your patients, in disaster scenarios, arrive?2) There are a few of us (at least) in the Pacific NW who are EMTs and Firefighters with many years of experience. Any recommendations on how we might get involved to help out?
What is your Land Rover history and what percent of your net worth have you sunk into to keeping them running? ;) 
Do u or your crew ever get claustrophobic? Thank you for your service. 
Thank you for your service , I sincerely mean that . What's the scariest situation you have encountered while at seas?
How out of date were the electronics and particularly the computers typically?What do you think in general about the disaster responses to the recent hurricanes?How is berthing and food and life in general on ships like that?
What's your favorite port of call you've been to? 
When do you expect to get to Puerto Rico?
I'm a nurse and I'm interested in volunteering on a mercy ship. Any idea who I should contact/what the details of that are?
Do you have a Captian Seaman aboard (not a joke)? My cousin was heading down but unsure of what fleet.
At any time serving upon a USNS ship, or any other classified relief ship, have you dealt with hostile actions while aboard(towards the ship)? If so what actions did the ship take/ is there a SOP for attempted boarding? I know pirates are prob out of their element with such a large ship but gotta believe a plan is in place. With merchant marines standing in as crew I gotta think this scenario is not gong to go to plan a lot of the time. Finally, Does this worry you when in "less regulated" parts of the world?
What are some ways you (general you (know him?)) keep morale up (or at least attempt to) for both the sailors and the patients?Also, do you like memes and if so, what are some of your favourites?
What sort of amateur radio do you have? HF? VHF? Can you transmit when on a naval vessel (I guess not). I'm reading up for my amateur radio exam in Ireland. 
Is there an item of comfort that you like keeping on you when you‚Äôre deployed?
This is a great AMA!  How long do you anticipate being in PR?  Do people come to the ship for aid or does ship personnel deploy to the land?Also, thank you for your service.  
fellow shipmate with you, stationed at pt. loma. I work with a lot of ITs and i have to ask...do you all play DnD?
Thoughts on the medical capacity of the Wasp class  ships? 
Hey man naval architect here. You guys do an awesome job.I'm interested in what kind of lifespan does the ship have and could it be retrofitted at the end to serve in a commercial function?Also do you ever hire commercial contractors for work on the ship (maintenance, repairs, etc)?I'm guessing the ship is ABS classed.
Did you run this AMA through public affairs officers?
What position do you play on the rugby pitch? Did you ever give the All-Navy rugby team a go?
What kind of lab tests do you do. For example can you just do pt and ptt or can you do more specialized testing like factor 8 deficiencies. If you have a lab how does getting inspected by CAP work?
How many seamen are on the comfort? Also are seamen just for men or are seawomen also classified as seamen?
First off, thanks for your service and the aid you will will be providing. I guess I'm most curious about what your overall mission is when you get to Puerto Rico. Also, how much time do you expect to spend there? 
I've seen the NatGeo docu on the Comfort.  Thank you for your service.  Its a great thing you do!  What is the route that the Mercy takes?
Hey doc, thanks for your service and hope y'all help the fuck out of our fellow Americans. Any advice for a new corpsman? Career wise/ in general. 
Hey shipmate (the good kind, not the kind Chief calls you), how did you manage to get orders to the MERCY for so long? You mentioned you weren't AD so are you now an IT contractor or did you become a Merchant Mariner?
Have you ever seen anything out on the seas that you could never truly explain? Sea monsters, ufos, ghost ships? Anything extraordinary like that?
Who's your money on for this next go around for the Rugby Six Nations?
26yo ham radio operator, former sysadmin, might try helicopters in the army. Thanks for doing what you do.Are you allowed to operate on ham radio while on a ship, when on land, how do you feel about the MARS (Military Auxiliary Radio System) programs slowly shutting down?
Hoorah, doc. How are you doing IT with that user name? I was 8404, but got out when they wouldn't let me switch to something computer programming related. My wife was part of the permanent skeleton crew on the Mercy a couple decades ago. Didn't leave port much. I used to do watch duty rounds with her because the lower decks creeped her out when it was dark and empty. Thanks for the AMA - I'm learning some stuff I never knew!
Hi there, was it your idea to do the AMA?
An American that likes rugby and land rovers? Have all my updoots 
Why is aide only now heading towards Puerto Rico?
Will you please take photos and post them here? Thanks for all that you do!
What is the scariest situation you've ever been in at sea?
Thanks for doing this. What‚Äôs the day to day routine like on the ship? Are there any special tasks to perform?
Are all the floors elf levelling? What is the cost of a ship like this?
I have heard several times that when disasters hit, the US send an aircraft carrier (Haiti was one of those case iirc) because their water treatment plant, power plant, and medical facilities make them perfect 'forward bases' to aid disaster zones.Are Hospital ships similar just specialized in that from the getgo rather than as a side effect of being a ship made to stay out at sea for long?  Or are them simply floating hospitals and dont really handle water and power aid but rather focus solely on medical treatment?  If the latter, is the US sending a carrier or something too?
When in deployment what is a typical workday or routine like for someone in IT? Also if it isn't too much what did you major in and how did you end up or decide to work for a sea going ship?
actually been debating joining the navy to become a corpsman. is there anything you wish you knew before hand? what is it like handling people back home and being active duty? have you had to relocate much? 
Why isn‚Äôt a ship of that size retrofitted with a reactor for more energy and less fuel cost?
With your knowledge of the USN and the ship, how much can you say on reddit and how much can you not?
What level one trauma do you expect to encounter almost a week after the event? I'm genuinely curious...
How much potable water can you make?
What role do you play on the mercy?
What took you so long?
Do you guys have a functioning trauma ED on the ship? Are things such as ventilators, bipaps, etc. ran through generator electricity from the ship?
How often do you get "you work in a hospital. Can you have a look at this?"
What is your fondest memory?I'm not even a USA citizen but I still like USA, thank you for your service.
I'll keep it simple as most of what can be asked has been covered: What's the funniest thing that has happened on board?Thank you for this AMA, you seem to care enough to know A LOT of technical stuff about this, it's a great read.
Few questions :)1. What're your favorite restaurants in San Diego?2. Do the ships perform more routine medical procedures (say someone in the disaster area needs something done but it isn't critical) or do you mostly hand immediate problems and stabilize?3. Have you ever had patients get sea sick or are the ships large enough that it isn't really a problem?
Are you active duty, or using the term sailor less as USN and more as someone who's on a ship? Curious because of 10 years straight.
Do you guys have fuel and helicopters? My understanding is that PR is decidedly infrastructure challenged right now and may not have roads. 
Retired MCPO here, you're doing great things and it gives my soul a smile!Since I'm supposed to ask a question:  are you PCSed to the boat or on Det?
Are you a Navy or Merchant Marine sailor? I did a tour on an Air Force USNS ship a few decades ago, but it was run by the Merchant Marines and so were our resupply ships.
What are the abandoned ship drills on there like? 
How's the job outlook for administrators on board?
Do you play overwatch?
Are aliens real?
how much are you charging per aspirin...I believe the going rate in your country is 10.00 USD a pill?
Thanks for the AMA !What would happen if some armed individual/s brake into the ship , let's say they were faking the help for aid and got on board then for whatever reason they decide to fire at other civilians or crew members . What kind of security do you guys have to prevent this from happening ?
This while thing seems like astroturfing for the military.
How do you like the new changes to Mercy? I think Mercy ult shouldn't last as long as it does and I miss the invulnerability a bit.
How do you feel about everyone always saying that they need healing?

Late to the party but I want to add to the wholesome chain. My cousin was in the Hershey Med Center this past July after having a non-cancerous brain tumor removed.

I spent a month using one of those knee scooters and I felt like an old lady. I'm glad someone young and fit is using one too so my cred is raised a bit.What a lovely post all round.
Who are these guys? 
What a cool dude
Not only my college, but Zack was part of my graduating class in high school. Incredible guy!
The man with the injured leg is one Torrence Brown, a defensive end for the Penn State football team.
This is precious. 
WE ARE!!!
Omg that's so sweet and adorable.
Am I supposed to know who any of these guys are?
I misread the title as "cocaine" and laughed when I saw the sub name, glad I was wrong!

You know he didn't eat those cookies :-(
Do you think he's an incel?
I want to live in a wholesoelmeme world. Thank you for this!

That scooter looks fun 
this is nice but hows this a meme
Are those trees?
That motorized scooter would have been so useful when I injured my ankle and had to hobble around campus on crutches for 3 months. I'll have to keep that idea in mind if there is a next time.

So, if Zack could just rock up and cheer me up with some cookies, that would be great. 
Are they both midgets?
Makes me proud to to spell my name with a K at the end. Keep up the good spirit Zack!
I needed this, especially after I had a scary zombie dream. Thank you!

Goddamnit now I want cookies.
This is the most important thing of the day. 
I bet he threw the cookies away, lol. 
Of course a downy gets extra privileges just because he looks like a potato and has the brain of one. His parents should've aborted him when they had the chance 
$50 says those cookies went straight in the bin üòÇüòÇ
This is why Reddit is superior over any other social media site 
Brownies would have been better.  Edit: apperently people don't like Danish charities. https://youtu.be/QHwsOPasF0s
Plot Twist: Those cookies were chocolate chip and psilocybin flavored. Enjoy your blast off into another dimension!
But what if you have diabetes?
He wouldn't have done this if he wasn't able to post it on social media afterwards.
HOLY SHIT I THOUGHT THE OTHER GUY HAD A PROSTHETIC LEG
my aunt had Down syndrome. Happiest people on earth. I think we are the ones that are not "normal."
are those weed cookies?
Lol sorry but it feels opposite that Zach isn't on that vehicle üòÇ
What a huge smile and such a boopable snoot as well!
Happy doggoüíï
I love the bandana! Where‚Äôd you get it?
omg, we don't have those till October.  We have few seasons in N Florida.  HOT n not as hot.
1. Cute!2. Is this some sort of pumpkin patch for people who live where they can't grow pumpkins?  They're just sitting there, with stems facing up instead of into the ground.
That is one happy puppy!
I think he likes YOU!
oh yeah!!!
I wonder what dogs think pumpkins are
Wow what a great picture. I can tell Maurice is loved. He's so cute üò≤üíÄ
Damn, I just want to hug him.
Floofus Boopersnoot!
That's cute 
"I'm a pumpkin too!"
wow what a H A P P Y B O Y E !!!
r/aww
Some people call him the gangster of love.
nice dogg
He liked it because you were there.
üòç
‚ÄúMaurice, the baguettes!‚Äù
I love autumn too bub!

Good doggo!
Nice going, Maurice.
Maurice is the goodest Boye.
that's cute, but I can imagine what would happen if lots of dog owners went to the pumpkin patch... I had some new neighbors move in, they think the sidewalk is their dog's toilet. Yay dogs...
What a cute little pumpkin patch doggo!
Quick someone make a joke about the dog that has a human name!
"I peed on all of these!"üê∂üê∂üê∂
This is a fantastic photo. Perfect. 
He's lovely and I'm honestly not trolling or trying to be negative but imagine you were running cross country and had to wear the equivalent of that bandana around your body. It's bound to be uncomfortable for him. Keep in mind that dogs are the most stoic creatures in the world that will not let you know anything until it becomes a huge issue. 
Well now what do we have here? I've always like corgis, they are so funny with their small legs! I especially like their fat tummies, it means that they are nice a healthy! They fat is always good to cool with, and they usually mature to harvesting at around 18months, but I usually keep them until around 24 months to ensure that they reach their full potential! Great job with this one! I hope you enjoy it!
I hope your family dies of aids. I'm a vegan and you're a slave owner of a poor animal. Fuck you and fuck white people, faggot.

The dead reddit bot needs to be this subreddit's logo.
How have I not seen this joke yet?
I very cautiously clicked on the sub Reddit, not knowing what to expect, scrolled down a bit and saw a link called something like 'peaceful theatre goers mercilessly killed by suicide bomber' I thought 'I'm going to regret this' clicked on it and.... 10/10 would click again.
We've gone too deep.
How long must we suffer.
FUCKING BRUTAL
The humanity 
Hi there. For a mobile version of reddit that doesn't takes days to load and return errors 50% of the time, add .compact to any link.         For example https://www.reddit.com/r/PeopleFuckingDying/.compact                It's from the "olden days" so I doubt it'll be around much longer* as it's not shit.

Great post
What the fuck is wrong with your keyboard.
Just wait for a hundred years. These guys will be dead by then
Goddammit I wish I‚Äôd thought of this joke
Meta as fukc

Must be something to do with having it in airplane mode. If only he had known we could have prevented this senseless tragedy
But did he hit her though?
Something about this makes me want linguini 
You're tearing me apart, Luke!
"So anyway, how's your sex life" has a whole new meaning in this context. 
The man who truly follows Jesus' teachings:"If a lot of people love each other, the world would be a better place to live"
Oh shit good one
I am literally watching The Room for the first time right now 
hahahahaha what a story Mark.
Sick liturgical year reference bro
Dank
How's your sex life?
The quandary is what to do after Luke.  Do you go on to John which is completely different, or skip to Acts the sequel to Luke.  
Easily one of my favorite memes ever right here 
Haven't read it.  But but God damn I know there's a huge back story.  Made me laugh.  Thanks. 
I‚Äôve never loved this sub more. 
What's this from? The picture. Thats travolta yea?
Hi 
I just watched that movie for the first time last night, at a theater, where everyone repeated lines and threw spoons at the screen and stuff. It was better/worse than I ever hoped or expected it to be
Thou shalt not hit her. Thou shalt naht!
Hi johnny
The room is the name of the film. He's Johnny!!! 
Blue Cross.
Dank.
Gods we were prophets back then
Wow
What a story, Mark! 
He didnt do it But Judas did
Lollll
Oh hi doggy
Please explain I am dying here !
I'm not even religious and this is good shit 
Its this a joke about how some believe that Matthew copied the book of Mark?
i believe women were made for fucking and cleaning
Funny to think a baby can have a sense of humour
It's just like when any of us accidentally say ow when it didn't hurt. 
[Sauce:](https://youtu.be/P7JLVushQV8) Because it is too cute not to hear. 
‚ÄúAHHHHH ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî Ahahahaha‚Äù
This cracks me up every time I see it. I love how he looks back at his dad right before he does it
That scared me. Way to go baby.
That is adorable. 
This kid is the worst kind of adorable naughty. You know you should tell them off, but, awwww....
This kid is going places.
This kid is already ready to be a parent.
I remember some BBC documentary a while ago that said children under the age of 5 have no sense of empathy. I guess that was bullshit.
Why is he using scissors to cut the fingernails of a baby... 
How many times has this been reposted?
Um why the hell is he using scissors anyway and not baby nail clippers? 
Ooh, that is bad. 
Damn, that's crazy that her cracks line perfectly up with mine! What are the odds?
Geez we get it, your girlfriends hot.
"You're lucky you got looks, Marge"
this belongs on /r/facepalm 
Tell her to switch to the front camera
OP - is that Camden, ME?
the 69% battery is def the hint
Send her a screenshot of your phone and say your phone cracked in same way.
You gotta appreciate the effort though.. 
Jesus Christ, I need an explanation. I'm not getting the joke
I'm viewing this picture through my own cracked screen.....so that's a pretty bad crack
Put it in a bowl of mice.
Nice OP, she must be incredibly attractive looking.
I once called my ex-girlfriend and told her I left my phone in her car and she looked for like 10 minutes before calling me back to tell me she couldn‚Äôt find it
I mean, to her it probably looked right with the crack in the screen
Is your girlfriend single? 
This is the biggest shitpost I've seen today.
haha thats cute. give her a kiss, boop her on the head and say "Good thing i only date you for your massive cans, sweetie"
You got me 
Nice! It doesn't have a single scratch, she got lucky! 
These comments are like watching an old episode of Beavis and Butthead.
You probably have to zoom in to see the crack.
My screen is cracked and it took me a second to realise what I was looking at. 
Looks like Camden maine
I don't get it. Is it because you can't see the cracks on the inside but she thought you should? Because that's totally what I got?
We get it, you have a gf. No need to rub it in.
Im guessing she has other "areas of expertise"...
It's shot.
>Here's your sign...
Well i am sure that apart from screen problem... the battery had suddenly discharged from 100% to 69% ;-) 
My screen is cracked so this actually works
SMH..... I looked at it and thought it was weird that she had the same damage as me.
I love Camden! 
My brain hurts just trying to imagine how she could think that the cracks would be visible on a screenshot.
I am, by know, officially a dumbass for searching the crack in this screenshot. 
Dang, I wish my girlfriend was as hot as yours must be.
It doesn‚Äôt look cracked to me :/
So not cracked at all then?
some people in here think the joke is that her phone wasnt cracked..lol
I remember a similar story way back on newsgroups... a dude wanted to know what are his chances of getting replacement monitor which had dead pixel OBO, and the guys asked him to show them with a picture so they could get a better estimate on how bad it is... The dude uploaded a screen shot and everybody died laughing while he was insistent that the dead pixel is visible _right there_... IT comedy in true form my fellas.
Took me longer then I'd like to admit...
Awwww. She's a moron. 
Wow that a screenshot can capture that! It really looks like the cracks in my screen
Shiiiiiit it took me a good few minutes before I realized you cant show cracks via screenshot.
We could already tell she doesn‚Äôt make the brightest decisions, she does have T-Mobile... 
and you're still dating her? 
/r/thatHappened 
Definitely a keeper!
Fine, I'll be the idiot that says it, I don't get it.
Who noticed the 69% as soon as you looked at the picture.
Fake.
Hope you paid for the insurance
That's because it's what's inside that counts. 
The crack on my screen has me for a second 
She's a keeper
i truly see nothing.
Shes got the exact same crack as i do!
Here i was thinking she got another phone or something...
My screen is crack too and I got really confused here for a second..
breh
Hmmm
It's looks pretty bad; oh wait that is my screen!
It took 200 years to harness the power of electricity, thousands over thousands of lives dedicated to the advancement of technology for the betterment of our lives. They want a refund.
Looks pretty bad. It's got moss growing in it, water and water vapor. Gonna need more than a new screen. 
you asked for the screen capture, didn't you OP
Please tell me i'm missing something. Is she just really dumb?
she was lucky then. 
In her defense, the screen technically isn't cracked I guess
Looks alright to me 
It looks exactly like my phone. What are the chances?
She is a nice person.
Wow, what a catch
*face palm*
I can tell the thought process was something like "Wait, how do I take a picture of my phone, when my phone is the thing I take pictures with?", and then she recalled a time someone made fun of her for taking a picture of a screen rather than a screenshot, and had an eureka moment.
... hahahah....id never let her live this one down if i were you.. this is awesome
You may be dating my daughter! smh
Oh bless her heart....
Tell her to delete the spiderweb app. 
It's so bad the water is coming in.
She's a keeper!
Oh dear, cracked lines on her phone screen looks like my phone cracked screen
I am guilty of doing this 
I once moved my head to the side to see what was going on to the side of the screen while skyping.
I once left a girl's phone at a festival charging station.  I went back to get it then took a snap of it to show her I got it. 
I thought the place that we all saw in the photo was something that cracked, like making a metaphor but noooooo... 
Oh no. That's sad. Just like mine.
She was smoking crack and dropped her phone?
I think your girls retarted bruh.
She's blonde?
haha, classic!
IPhone users smh
You are so kind to her she is still your gf.
Wow, look at all that damage!
You're girlfriend is smart.
Yikes...
Is that Camden, Maine?
This should be in r/facepalm
69% battery life.
she might need a new phone
69 lol
Maybe she sent it because of the battery percentage?( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Looks almost as bad as mine
Looks fine.
Is that Bar Harbor?
doesn't look all that bad, barely visible.
Probably a blonde.
Oh She's a keeper....
I need a woman 
There was an attempt
Totally unuseable. Poor gal.
I think she maybe retaeded, OP.
I wish I could "üòÇ" react to this post, OP.
Seems fine. Oh...wait.
Did you end the relationship immediately? "I'm sorry Babe. It's just not working out. It's not you. It's me." 
My phone is so cracked I don't know where the cracks are if that's what we are looking for..
We have ourselves a dud folks. 
Hey! If I'm not mistaken that's Camden harbor, about 15 minutes from my home in Maine :3
This needs to be in /r/onejob.
Former coworker in IT had a user send him a "print screen" screen shot, as the user was complaining that his monitor coloring was off and had some faint banding as well. Had to spend waaaaay too long explaining why he'd have to go to the user's desk to see the problem in person...
It took me a moment. 
I mean, mine's broken too so it works for me
Looks like you picked yourself a real winner.
I like my women smart
That matches my screen crack exactly. What a small world.
üòÇüòÇ
So just about as cracked as mine!
I hope she's pretty
I'll bet your girlfriend is one of those strong independent types... 
That screenshot looks like its from the top of mt batty, Camden maine
I seriously thought it was a photo after the hurricane of an island.  Couldn't figure out why that would show the screen crack.  Ugh
Duh, doesn't she understand the camera just faces out of the back of the phone ?! She should have switched it to selfie mode to photograph the crack.
She's a keeper!
i'm gonna say it... I can't find the crack!
Haha.... this never happened tell your hand hey for me
That's crazy. Her screen broke the exact same way mine did!
IF THIS IS TRUE, SHES NOT THE ONE MAN...shes, ugh, too slow for u. You can find a far more intelligent lady (cuz u don‚Äôt want a child with below average IQ) just around the corner at any bar, restaurant, walmart, target, etc. 
69%
Oh is that a photo of Maine?
Is this true? It cant be true.. bad joke is all, right?
Maybe when you become some sort of professional.....you can joke about how dumb she is.....just for shits and giggles...Ya shit head.
A friend of mine did the same the other day.  My screen is getting wet, and is expanding.  Here, see how bad it is!! (Sends a screenshot)  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
i dont get it..
I still dont get it üòê
Is she mentally retarded?
It raining bad, bad, bad it is. 
My screen is pretty bad, so I probably see it how she does. I should probably send you guys a picture. 
When my screen started to glitch (pink stripes, color gradients with a solid black stripe in the middle... etc)I sent screencaps to my mom. Was curious if that would actually work.
hey pal, you just blow in from stupid town?
The sex must be fantastic. 
Your kids are going to be retarded if you stay the course.  
Gotta dump the dumb bitches, asap.
I hope shes really hot for this to be overlooked XD jusst kidding, something I would do. 
Or op just took a screenshot.  Shit post.
This is not someone you should marry.
I find this so endearing! Because she was probably so nervous and preoccupied that she thought this was the best way to help them understand how bad the situation really was.
69% üòè
How badly did she crack her head when her parents dropped her? 
Is she blond?
She's got 69% charge left. You know what to do, son. 
Marry her. 
the battery is 69%.
69%. Nice. 
The new iPhone X actually has sensors that pick up on the distortions due to damage on the capacitive screen, it then simulates the cracks, and incorporates them into the screenshots you take. It's really nifty. No more unrealistic screenshots like this.
Please get a divorce
Wow what a unique post, I've never seen anything like this.This sub is a joke in itself,  it's on the same level as one of this "funny" Facebook accounts desperate for shares.
I dont get it
Maybe it's the 69% she was referring to......dropping a wee hint
Blonde?
American girlfriend 
[deleted]
She must be a looker
Blonde 
I seriously doubt this happened. 
OP literally took a screenshot of his phone and made a phony title for karma. /r/thathappened
Is your girlfriend 13 years old?
DUMP. HER. ASS.
FYI this is a bot account. Most likely an ad for T-Mobile and/or IPhone
That took me way longer than it should have...
Looks fine to me...
Dumb girls are for fucking, not dating.
69%
Sorry, this makes no sense. Downvote.
Well it's not like she'd have had another phone on hand to take a photo of her phone... üò¨
She's a Trump supporter, Huh?
Better this way than those shits on youtube who hold a phone up to their laptop to record clips. Did you expect her to have another phone to take the picture ???
69. Lol
Some say men are smarter than women, others say women arent as smart as men, we may never know who is right.
Here in the Netherlands nearly all public outdoor stairs have them
Isn't this everywhere?  It's on all stations in Denmark
What does it do now? 
Awkward meeting in the middle when two people are going up and down at the same time.
Wait, it's not a public urinal trough?Hm, TIL I've been doing it wrong for a while. No wonder people stare and jeer at me.E- Make a quick quip, slip out to the fire for a couple hours and a handful of beers, and I come back to break 100k. Thanks!
Or a toy car race track
Thesse arent everywhere in the world?
It‚Äôs for mouse wheelchairs
You meant to say ride, right? 
I saw these everywhere in Sweden if the sidewalks didn't already have a ramp built into them.
Those are quite common here in Denmark at train stations. 
We have those all over in Denmark. Almost as normal as the stairs
I don‚Äôt know if this isn‚Äôt a thing in every city on earth, but here in eastern Europe it‚Äôs everywhere.
Seen them here in Norway too, but I've only seen them paired with the perfect distance appart to also accommodate wheelchairs.
What is so special? These are all over in the Netherlands...
Welcome to all of Japan
Seen these my entire life basically everywhere in Sweden, might be a new thing in other places though
I see this everyday in Finland
Thats not that interesting for me, these are pretty common in The Netherlands lol üòÇüòõ
What does the tray do now?
‚Äú*Is used to‚ÄùTook me a minute to figure out this was /r/mildlyinteresting and not /r/nostalgia
I bet skaters eat that shit up.
Tray you say. I would call this more of a channel maybe? 
I don't get what's so mildly interesting about this, we have them everywhere in The Netherlands..
We've seriously had these in Copenhagen for at least 8-10 years...big vup.  Downvoted for being to plain of an everyday thing.
My city has one of these at the main transit terminal. Everyone with a bike uses the elevator anyway.
Is this in Copenhagen?
Well I am a huge idiot ! I though it was for the rain :/
Uh, correction: That is a public hotwheels track.
TIL bike rails on stairs are apparently a big deal outside of the Netherlands and the rest of Europe
"Walk"
I believe you mean ride*
Yeah, cool, but it's so much faster to throw it on your shoulder.This design also may impede those needing the handrailing the most.Just sayin'z I know it's not your design.
Had these in Germany while I lived there for two years. My buddy and I would ride down them. Sometimes we would crash. 
Right... "Walk"
I would definitely be that person who tries to ride up or down in the tray
I used to try to ride up these as a whippersnapper and used to ride down it too they have these on both sides of the bike path on the Sydney Harbour Bridge https://www.google.com.au/maps/@-33.8463434,151.2118785,3a,75y,157.49h,84.07t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sT-28jQN5EmeAF307_sPtrw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656
I would totally ride my bike down the slide
Well, what does it do now?
It used to, but it doesn't anymore? Bummer. 
This things are everywhere in Moscow as well.
Do the handles of the bike have enough space to not rub against the wall to the left?
Bullshit. Its a wheelchair ramp for iguanas.
THAT'S WHAT THOSE THINGS ARE?!?
WHY ARE WE NOT FUNDING THIS?!
why did it stop?
We have these everywhere in Germany. Are they so uncommon?
I don't like the side-walls, too easy mode.
Now, extreme mothers can grind their strollers.
ITT: Dutch people like bikes. 
Remember when bikes were actually heavy?
Thought this was /r/crappydesign as a design for a wheelchair or a child trolley... 
What's the point of putting a hand rail on the same side as it though?
Or a slide for extremely tiny people 
Rofl. This reminds me of the super popular video ive seen on reddit showing european windows and blinds. I was like THE FUCK is interesting about this.
Challenge accepted mate...
These are the norm in the netherlands and not special at all
I really feel like tray is the wrong word here... track?
Steps that wide indicate heavy foot traffic at times. If there is heavy foot traffic on these stairs it is only a matter of time before someone trips badly on that thing. It's shitty for the infirm too as it makes the handrail unusable. In fact it looks so close to the rail that the handlebars of a bike would hit them making the rail impractical for anything but racing matchbox cars. 
Is it grindable? 
This looks like it would add an extra level of pain to falling down these stairs
If that were in my country it'd ripped up overnight and sold for scrap
nice idea, but what if someone has to go up and someone has to go down at the same time when there's a lot of foot traffic?
My hill needs this. Carrying my sons bike to the top of the stairs to be able to ride it on flat ground is almost not worth the effort and this would make it so much simpler. They literally just redid most of the staircases in the last year too! They should have added this
I've seen some of these on train/metro stations in Mexico and always wondered what they're for.
Walk?
You probably still have to walk your bike by yourself.  That tray looks like it is there to smooth out the bumps
I hope nobody trips on it.
Oh, that's what those are for. TIL.
ramp and lever at work. simple machines
*Metallica blares as Vin Diesel grinds down that thing on a lunch tray while wearing sunglasses*
no, this is for slinkies with disabilities, duh
Overdone tag plz
Now it's for nascar toys!
Bike track says you. Hot wheels track says I
Hot wheels ramp!
These are all over amsterdam...took me a second to realize what they were
I dont want to deceive but Its standard here in Belgium.
Thanks, Sherlock
"Walk your bike" yeah right, that's a roller coaster if I've ever seen one
Why don't they use it anymore?
Wasn't this ramp made just for that marble racing dude?
Then it started hanging with the wrong crowd...
"Yeah just put it right in front of the hand rail so people can't use it. The elderly and disabled have already got enough kick-backs."
I find it dangerous, especially for older people than need the railing. 
Is this the new fancy scaffolding? This is literally everywhere in europe.
I would trip and die
I'd pee down it.
These are everywhere in Sweden! I like to slide down them when nobody is watching. 
I've seen these in Finland, too. 
I‚Äôve never seen that before...genius...
paint it orange and it can be my hot wheels track
What about a disabled person who needs to grip a handrail with their left hand for example? Going upstairs would be a lot more difficult possibly as the bike ramp may inhibit their walking? 
The design I always loved was [steps in the center of a steep driveway](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a1/25/6f/a1256f97954e6e38f9df8362931d54f2.jpg). I was raised in Seattle and saw many of them in hilly neighborhoods, really nice brick driveways with brick steps. Some go down too, into a basement garage. 
I really want to pee in it at the top.
It needs more Hotwheels...
Ride*
It's the little things, innit?
Seems like this particular one would get in the way of anyone who needs to use the railing. 
I recall seeing these everywhere in Germany. A neat concept.
Maybe if you have weak baby arms 
Gave myself a good chuckle when seeing the railing. "U people use railing to carry your bicycle up and down? BMX style??"Then I saw the tray and feels like an idiot. Should have view the full picture. A really good idea! I don't think we have such things in Malaysia. I could be wrong though. 
This is in Denver at the bridge crossing into commerce park! 
So, it doesn't anymore?
I expected robots with trays dammit.
What does it do now then?
You see this everywhere in, biking nation, the Netherland. 
It's for rollerblading down on one foot
See one everyday in the netherlandsüá≥üá±üá≥üá±
Switzerland?
Or if you're totally rad you'd ride your bike down it and get all that sweet 15 y/o BMX kid cred
And now it just SITS there, passive and hopeless.
Pretty much everywhere in Europe
I'd like to see someone actually ride down this. Talk about scary shit. 
Pretty common in The Netherlands.
That's for amateurs. I just ride my bike up stairs.
My dumbass would try to ride my Heely's down that shit
Looks like a tripping hazard for people that actually need to hold on to the railing. 
Wait what happens when someone going up and something going down both have bikes?
The first time I saw one of these, I though you could ride up it on your bike.Cue me stacking it a few centimetres up and catching myself on the stairs.
> This tray *that is* used to help bring your bike up the steps with ease. Makes more sense.
[Millennium Bridge](https://ssl.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000QhMDvFTsQA8/s/850/850/20130721-denver-136.jpg) in Denver, CO has them too. I once heard a woman say "that's what those are for" while I walked my bike up it.
We usually have 2 so you can take a stroller up/down.
They use these here in Thailand, but often they're stolen to sell for scrap metal, so now a lot of staircases are just built with a cement ramp on the side instead.
It's really common in China too 
I lived above a cliff face over a park for a few years growing up, they had a similar setup but it was just a concrete ramp alongside the stairs. Wish more places had them.
These are all over in any city that has high bike traffic... 
Why put it next to the hand rail? 
Walk?Here, hold my beer.
Skate spot!
Or if you‚Äôre a psychopath, ride your bike down 
It still does but it used to, too.
As a Dutch person, this is nothing new for me
This is very common in most of the Netherlands!
These have been around for thousands of years 
I wanna ride it
it's also dank for hot wheels
Used to?  What does it do now?
Is this not something people are familiar with?
This is mildly interesting nowadays?
https://goo.gl/maps/W6CEAs6vqkS2Ramp is only on one side. It's awkard when bikes meet in the middle.
There's one of those here in Denver on the big fancy pedestrian bridge downtown, it's poured into the cement though. And very useful, I've gotten to use it a few times 
What if im going up... and someone is coming down.Back to the drawing board guys.
Yea... "walk" it...
This is a future spam account, just a heads up.
It used to, but  it doesn't feel like it anymore
If you guys like this, you're going to shit yourselves when you see the wheelchair ones! 
Can also be used for unicyclists to go downwards.....
Tray?
r/MildlyInteresting, the place where even if you see it all the time so it's par for the course someone else posts it and gets k's of up votes.I moved from a place with no subways to a main city, thought it was peculiar to see but normal to have due to its prevalence here. 
From a usability viewpoint, I don't think the ramp should be so close to the handrail. Those that need the handrail would be people with difficulty walking, they won't have bikes with them and those wheeling their bikes would usually have both hands on the bike. Makes more sense to have the bike ramp in the centre.
More like a challenge 
That'd be dope for hotwheels
They've got these in Stockholm.
Hmmm but at least in the steps you can stop for a moment and take breath, with this you'd have to actually go all the the way up 
Looks like a good way to fuck yourself up if you trip
Does the hand rail get in the way?
i have seen these multiple times without knowing what they do
is it really a thing? in Denmark it's everywhere.
What does it do now?
Does this also make riding your bike down the stairs more viable ?
More of a rail than a plate tho. 
Wait, isn't this a thing all around the world? I've seen these all over the country since the USSR era, but we have 2 rails so that parents of small children could move baby carriages without lifting them up.
Used to? Why doesn‚Äôt it anymore? 
In The Netherlands these are built into the stairs themselves. Yay bycicle country
These are everywhere in Holland
Loads of these in the UK, stupid post.
I bet this is in the Netherlands 
I'm just kicking the fuck outta that and cutting my fucking foot up. 
You can see things like these all over the place where I live
not special, these are everywhere.
did anyone else read this wrong the first time
Walk up, *ride* down.

Alternative title: how to spot "boy" in drawing of a boy.
Got a little Sherman and Peabody thing going on.
Umm, the first skill is being able to write "boy" that perfectly. That's where I stop.
I remember this shit. Same month I mastered [this thing](https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/07/27/that-s-thing-everyone-drew-in-school-what-is-it-body-image-1469592131-size_1000.jpg?output-quality=75).I tried to figure out a way to turn 'girl' into a girl and came up with some of the weirdest, most abstract porn you've never seen.
Next we‚Äôll learn how to make the Superman S from 6 lines 
...his boy Elroy 
No way.I learned this from an after school tutor over two decades ago. No one that I have ever shown it to had seen it before. I started to think maybe that tutor invented it.Yet here it is. And now everyone will know it. The insanity of only me knowing it will finally end.
Greatjob!
Why does he look like Griffin McElroy
You can do the same with fish
Jesus. I was doing this in 1973. Without the earrings.
Yeee boyyy.
I think I know that kid.
I love these sorts of drawings. I learn them and amaze my kids. I especially like [this YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpEoy8gmYo4o9eADt-DGiVpFlwloGr47l) for more like this. There was an Instagram I saw once with these,too, but I can‚Äôt remember what it was.

one can do the same thing with bed without paper and using digital fonts.bed
In Portuguese you can draw a puppy from the word "asshole"
This is hella useful.

You can do a girl with the number 55
I still do this 
You did good

This is kindergarten stuff. Good times
This is how I'm going to draw every single boy from now on
Aw man that was always my go to trick. Now people are gonna know haha 
Did you just assume that drawing's gender? 
I remember doing this in the fifth grade with my friend. Everyone started to be disappointed when they found out we couldn't make a girl from "girl".
Quit giving away my secrets! I've fooling people with this drawing for years, üòÜ Nice post OP. 
Add a scar and it's the boy who lived.
[Nailed it!](https://imgur.com/a/CCqcP)
I see "booty up", so that could also mean "boy"
My friend and I used to do this for random words in class in 7th grade. We made a character out of the name "Jimmy" which was one of our classmates. I probably wouldn't be able to recreate that character unfortunately, it's been almost 20 years at this point.

did you just assume that boys gender
Looks like Ellen
Fuck off with your gender normative depiction of boys shitlord.
Did you just assume that word's gender?
Assuming genders in 2017 smh
Every shot of your city would be full of garbage.
The mailman would update daily 
You'd have to address the streets where they go before the sun rises, but this is a good idea. 
Having worked on Google Earth projects, capturing data is only one part of the project.  You aren't considering the months of data processing, colour balancing, obscuring out sensitive material, georeferencing, etc that goes into updating one city.  Updating weekly is just an impossible timeline.
Rural areas would still be fucked
Google recently introduced a feature where you can cycle through old versions of street view. I constantly find myself wishing they had street view from pre 2007. Like 1878 street view would be awesome. How will the geniuses of Google crack the code?!
Saturday Morning:*Google announces new way to keep google streets updated weekly.*
Depends. Garbage trucks are often too tall to capture good spherical imagery (because you can‚Äôt just place a spherical camera right on it, you have to elevate the camera on the rod to ensure it stitches correctly), especially for things that are usually ~1m above the ground like mailboxes and house numbers. If you‚Äôve ever seen a Street View car-recorder, it‚Äôs a small crossover/sedan because it needs to be close to the ground to get meaningful imagery (even so the cameras are almost 3m above ground). Placing the cameras on the sides of the trucks would make it much harder to stitch well and could be impossible on the right side for the mechanical arm types. disclaimer: unchecked brain vomit
who needs to see the weekly change?
Annually is fine, just use Santa.
It would be alarming to see how much garbage gets thrown out every week. 
Try https://mapillary.com - has street imagery from garbage trucks, bikes, casual drivers, hikers, boats, and more! New photos coming in every day. :)
Orwellian fuckin robot that OP is. Wants to monitor our every move and tricks us into it with it's cute wit.***FUCK YOU ROBOT! YOULL NEVER GET ME UNLESS YOU DO BECAUSE YOU OPERATE AT A HIGHER EFFICIENTLY OVERALL WHEN COMPARED TO MY MEEK AS FUCK FUCKIN ASS***  
I think the biggest problem with the idea of weekly updates would be the logistics of blurring out faces, license plate, etc.
And if we mounted a camera on OP's mom we could also get the interior of every house.
Yeah I'm totally cool with people NOT taking pictures of my house every day and uploading them to the internet.
Just wait for Google Maps live, where every step you take is being tracked, and every single person in the world can see what you are doing in just a click of a button.
Most residences would also be at risk of being partially distorted by the garbage cans.
That‚Äôs true
Or better yet mount it to Johnson‚Äôs truck...I see that guy everywhere. 
Wouldn't the pics stink?
On Taxis for best update rate, I think.
Development isn't happening at a rate that reasonably justifies the need for such a consistent rate of updating. 
This will be very useful in towns where residents must bring their own garbage to the town dump...
Around my area we'd mostly get just the alleyways.
Everyones bins would always be out. 
The mailman, ice cream trucks, and even that creepy van that follows you home at times 
Why not on top of postal service trucks? 
Yeah but when they incorporate smellivision to the internet your whole house will smell like the dump
Nice try, raccoon.
It's about time trash pandas got their own TV show. 
Obviously it's different in other cities but where I'm from, garbage collection is mostly a back alley thing.  Which would be interesting but probably not that helpful.  Google should partner with cab companies - sure, some roads wouldn't get updated that often but high-traffic ones (probably the most searched anyway) would be piping fresh.
Ur such a deep thinker that if Aristotle and Plato had a baby....... they would sacrifice it to appease ur philosophical wrath
Dont give them ideas damnit!
The garbage men don't come down my street though.  They drive down the alleyway behind my street where the dumpsters are.  The mailmen doesn't come down the street most of the time either since we have those big consolidated mailboxes.  The only time they come down the street is to deliver a package and they get lazy and don't even do that half the time.
Or we could put them on all police cars and... Uh... Oh wait, they'd never get turned on.
There would be a gallery of me running out to the curb half-dressed every Monday morning at 7 fucking 30. 
Of alleys
Tesla self driving garbage trucks.
Brilliant!!! And I'm not even British 
someone at google headquarters just got a massive headache thinking about the logistics of this 
Those Cameras would get stolen very quickly. Garbage trucks would be easy targets since they frequently stop whereas google cars are actively moving.
Picture quality would be rubbish though 
What a trash idea.
This is bad idea since the photos are a small part of the process, you have to blur everything and also edit everyone photo and also make a 3d map of it so you can look around and go forward and backward and many more things like their geographic location.
Do garbage trucks only collect trash once a week in the cities too? The truck in my area crosses my street every fucking night at 3 am
One step closer to dystopian surveillance hell.
Wouldn't we also end up with a Big Brother style Garbage Police state?
Why should society give that very valuable data to a private for-profit corporation to make money on when we can instead put that data under a copyleft license (f.e. CC-BY-SA) so that anyone can use it and share it, including Open street maps and even Google?
also give your mailman a gps locater to create a more accurate map for pedestrians.
R:\Program Files\Google?
Data overload is already a problem.  Let's create more.  It's waste.
I live in a city where trash is collected in alleyways behind the main streets. Obviously the trash trucks ride on main streets but they don't drive on all of them.
Why not put it on postal vans, same routes without any eyesores of garbage!!
Put it on UPS/DHL/... trucks and you'll get daily updates, less garbage bins and less cars everywhere since nobody is at home when they are delivering.Edit: well, I wasn't the only one thinking about that...
Postal vehicles would be better...
Everything would be shot while it's still dark out.
I know everone is pointing out how only certain times and streets would be updated but its still a good idea. Too bad Waste management is owned by the mafia
Yeah but the pictures would stink.
You smart
So the people check google earth and every bit of street is trash and garbage bags over every sidewalk... You didn't think that one through.
Only problem IS that someone would have to edit The pictures together
[repost](https://amp.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/6c0nun/if_you_mounted_garbage_trucks_with_cameras_you/)Of a [repost](https://amp.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/2hm8se/if_you_would_mount_garbage_trucks_with_cameras/)Against /r/showerthoughts rules OP
Bro...  
They would then catch the images of all the times they just slam my garbage containers on the street. 
Piles of trash everywhere...
Dude, that's actually a great fucking idea. I hope you came up with that. Google has enough money to send out cameras to people who know what they're doing. They could make it so that you have to volunteer so they don't get tons of applications from people wanting to get paid. You know there are people out there who would wan't to do this for free. Only problem I see, is people would probably complain about privacy, which is fair.
And now Google are looking into buying all the rubbish collection services in the world
They would still have to process all that imagery. Blurring every single license plate and face on every street would be impossible to do every week.
Or if they used the 360 view cameras in most modern cars, they could update daily. 
They‚Äôll partner with Lyft. You can guess the rest. 
Saw a Google Streetview car yesterday parked in a CVS (I think the driver was getting something to drink or taking a break) - But, she literally put a large cover over the camera & equipment for this short break. People must be weirded out by these things like Google Glass or something, even though its widely used all the time.
But the pictures would be trash.
Feels like that would be a massive amount of data. Even by Google's standards.  
Or it'll happen once their self driving car comes out
Mailman, trashman, these are both brilliant. 
all the streets would be full of trash cans
Ingenious!
I think the issue isn't taking the pictures so much as processing and posting them. 
But they‚Äôd also have to process all that data.
You need people to blur faces and license plates
You should look a project called safecast. They started in Japan with cheao car mounted radiation monitors after Fukushima. Now they are doing the same with air pollution monitors. Cheap, car mounted equipment is super powerful in terms of the info it can gather 
We'd also find out that most recyclables end up in the landfill. Green washing is real
The time it would take to stitch all the images together properly would take a while I'm assuming. 
You would need a hell of a lot more cameras though to cover the same area as one google car
Aside from the aforementioned data processing issue, the space required to store weekly iterations of that many images would probably cripple Google's whole data storage system.
They already do 71913
Updating that often is just hell.
But all of Streetmap would be pretty dark and "night mode" as most trucks operate early mornings... A user-based but moderated date source might be more fruitful. (See mapilarry)
Imagine the cost of outfitting every vehicle not to mention the logistic insanity
Could be more interested if like adsense google payout people replacing vehicle Flashlights with Google Cam built-in flashlights. It might reduce Crime, you never know which vehicle is watching ..
Whoever makes those google cameras stock would rise about 2830129%
Yeah except the concern with surveillance would come up again, and that program probably would not even take off because of public opinion.
Google maps jumped the shark in 2013. All their updates are to remove shit that used to work better than it does now. I wish it had more competition.
Garbage trucks have cameras
1...Image cleanup would be tremendous amount of work.2... do we reeeally need that level of imagery-viewable-by-anyone-for-any-rea$on.
Once people figure it out that street view is updated at a regular timing interval, there's gonna be so much street sex every time the garbage man comes by.
Mandatory cameras on every car. 
This is a fucking good idea
So, what I'm gathering from this post and comments, is that Google needs to create a smart garbage disposal service and/ or mail delivery service... And throw some drones in for good measure.
Every 2nd week in Sweden
Maybe google will start paying people to keep a camera on their cars to update the maps where they're driving. But would it be profitable? Nah...
Honestly. Apple should do it too. My house has been around 3 years and still not on apple maps.
Street view would look trashy though.
Btw this is how Google Street view looks in Germany...[Street view Germany](https://i.imgur.com/g0UimUP.jpg)
Alright there, Dr. Evil.
There is so much we do in transportation that is super inefficient. Like I just moved to Texas and 9/10 trucks (especially the bigger ones not the small ford rangers) have nothing in their truck beds and have one person in the car. And btw a limo is a better trash truck.
They already do, well at least where i am. It‚Äôs on the rear recording what‚Äôs coming out of the bins into the bin lorry, so if people are putting no recyclable waste in their waste bins we can prosecute them.  
I mean. Yeah. 
That idea stinks.
I'm guessing collecting and downloading the streetview data is a little more involved than just connecting to wifi or docking a device, because that is what it would take to get a third party to bother with it. USPS, FedEx, UPS can barely handle their own IT, they certainly aren't prepared to have somebody maintain and monitor such equipment, unless Google pays for every dime of the labor and capital. We will eventually get there, but it will probably have to be completely passive, with a technician stopping by once a month or something like that.
The cost would outweigh the benefit by leaps and bounds, simply put. 
Not in UK - bins only collected every 2 weeks. I used to work for one of UKs largest refuse collection orgs, for their onboard Technology team. Could see this happening as there is already tons of IT wizardry on these trucks. This is on the assumption that the driver doesn‚Äôt have to do anything to make it work!
The police state is probably already on the job 
You get weekly garbage pickup?? Damn.
My city does have cameras on the garbage trucks. The trucks are shiny clean and white. Richland, Washington.
Not to mention not everybody gets there trash picked up
That would be a lot of throwaway footage. 
What has four wheels, and flies and now updates the Google Map?
Its not as simple as that
Or usps
I've always wanted a timelapse of my changing city.
That would require a massive amount of data storage, even by Google's standards.  Then there's the massive amount of post-processing and quality control on a perpetual basis.  Then there's the work to ensure no privacy lawsuits.All of that on top of the equipment and operating cost just to get the data in the first place.All of this so that Street View can show largely the same things over and over.  Not much changes on such a short time scale.
Sadly no, the most work is stitching the images together, not taking them. It really is time my neighbourhood got uldated though.
Of course, all you need are some pictures /s
I would think this could screw a lot of people over.Maybe you said you were someplace, but, oh look!, your car wasn't there that day. Gonna be a no from me. 
Thinkin' the same thing three weeks ago.
I feel like privacy groups would go ballistic over this. Having cameras patrolling the streets and posting immediately to the internet would open a Pandora's box.Think of the court cases that would affected by nearly full time surveillance.
I remember how shocked i was when i first found out you can see what any address in the world looks like on google. Now i'm so used to it that it is no longer interesting
Or postal service trucks which would update almost daily
And the NSA wouldn't have to bother tapping our phones
Or get every frame ever shot with a dashcam and make a big deal time photogrammetry model of our planet update within minutes and reverseable. Then add every cellphone camera and microphone that is ok or off and get even more video data.Make a whole planet model in real time and quit working for the Skynet NSA
I think the surface area of the truck's roof would be an issue, but good thought.
Google hasn't updated my county in 3 years.
Self driving cars will have cameras on them which will no doubt feed back to Google and others for helping the self driving tech and street view.
Hope not in Nigeria!
Nope. Would cost too much to QA and censor all the captured images. 
You‚Äôre optimistic about the frequency of rubbish collection.
The Google trash program
If we had better garbagemen, we would have better garbage collection
That wwould definitely not be a good thing
thats a surprisingly good idea. 
This is actually a great idea. 
A yearly update would be more reasonable. There are parts of my town where it's a few years out of date. Locations where building and roads have been constructed/changed.
I've actually suggested that USPS partner with Google. We could have daily updates and Google would power our GPS system.
My pops is out there.  Spoke to him yesterday.  Boiling water on a campfire and cooking chef boyardee in the can on the fire also.  He is eating one can a day but drinking plenty of water.  He is about a hour and a half from San Juan but with the roads the way they are its a couple of days to get there.  So as soon as I can get a flight out he's coming here.
Anybody have suggestions on what one could feasably do to help out? 
Puerto Rican here. We (my extended family & me) are using a generator to power our fridge, modem and a fan for 8 hours. Having internet service somehow makes me privileged right now, so I'm trying to use it.  No one has electricity and most people don't have running water. Gas and drinking water are still scarce and hard to get. Only cash is being accepted at most stores, but many banks are still not open and many ATMs still don't work, no credit cards accepted. Most phones don't work unless you are in the highway and in the metro area, so if someone had to dial 911 from home they would die trying. Hospitals are running out of diesel to power up their generators every other day so people are dying because they can't get treated for their dialysis or any other type of life support, because the diesel is scarce or unavailable. Some people are still land locked and some are drinking water from  creeks. People are doing hours long lines to get food or gas.  I would not end if I were to mention everything going wrong at the moment. To top it all off many of us have not been to work since hurricane Irma which was almost a month ago, so we don't have any money (many people are loosing their jobs permanently too) and we have been stuck inside our homes for that long, with nothing to do but stare at the ceiling all day. Our houses have become scarcity Jails. This is a very draining and mentally straining situation. PLEASE don't be fooled by any media outlet or politician saying we are doing better, WE ARE NOT, keep talking of us, we need it, I beg you. 
It's been lost in the chaff, but the US Navy's hospital ship USNS COMFORT deployed today for Puerto Rico from Norfolk, VA.She is the second largest level one trauma center in the eastern US, 13 stories tall and the length of 3 football fields and she will be in San Juan in a few days to be the regional trauma and specialty referral center for Puerto Rico and the Caribbean at large.She can make her own power, water, and oxygen; has a wide array of satellite and radio communications systems, can embark both military and civilian health care providers, and is a critical command and control node for disaster relief operations for the Department of Defense.Here is an idea for what she brings to the table:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JNNYaINshQ
Put yourself in the position of a rural Puerto Rican. There's no electricity and your running low on food and water. You also have no way of knowing if any help is on the way to assist you and it's been more than a week. Even if you have some money saved to purchase goods, without electronic banking you can only pay in cash. When people get put in desperate situations it becomes about survival and bad things can start happening.
Puerto Rico's ports are sitting on supplies but their infrastructure is damaged to a point that they're unable to distribute it. They really need the solid logistical capability of the military to get the supplies out to the hospitals and shelters, and power technicians to get their electrical grid back up and running. 
I'm a wireless network engineer. I'm trying to find a way to help out. Volunteering installing infrastructure. All I need is a cot and food. I think I even have enough Delta miles. What's the best way to get connected and do something?
> "And a very big question is, what are we going to do with the power plant? Because the power plant is totally wiped out," he said. "There is nothing. The power grid is gone."Jesus, fuck. I'd help you Puerto Rico, but I haven't the skills nor money to even help. 
The Coast Guard is sending a LOT of people down to PR for aid and relief from all over the country. We had 3 flight mechanics from my shop alone who are already in route to the island for search and rescue efforts and I‚Äôm in Alaska.  God bless the people of PR and keep it up USCG! Source: currently active coastie. 
So, honest question. Please blow this shit up because I'm abso-fucking-lutely serious.I'm a vet on disability and have literally all the time in the world to go help. Where can I turn to in order to get some direction to go volunteer for anything? Cleaning porta-shitters or whatever. 
My FB feed has shown significantly more passion and anger over the difference between standing and kneeling than about Americans being allowed to suffer and die in PR.
My friend is a Blackhawk pilot in the Army and is down there right now providing aid. They need more help,  But there are people down there working their ass off helping. 
Headed to San Juan early Sunday morning to help restore solar panels. What should I bring, both personally and to help others?
Why is this not dominating the media right now?
God this is truly terrifying. My family is there and there's not much at all I can do to help them. These people are suffering they've been sent back to the dark ages by this hurricane and they need help.
I would like to pay for a flight out of the area for someone in Puerto Rico back to the mainland. If that is you, please contact me. 
If anyone is there with an internet connection please tell us your experience
I don't want to hear this bullshit. USAF C-17 pilot with the air national guard here, and I can tell your we've been flying our assess off in support of all of the major storms (keep in mind there have been several) since last month. We've been bringing everything from peace keeping to humanitarian supplies. We can get the supplies there no problem. It's off loading and disseminating these supplies that's the problem.Here's another aside -- if you haven't noticed, there a lot of other mil operations going on, so the majority of these hurricane relief missions have fallen on the national guard command and control as opposed to the normal active duty C2 agencies. The crews and support personnel at the local levels have stepped up considerably to handle much of this planning autonomously (fortunately we're trained to do that)And I can tell you I haven't even been paid because finding is so messed up right now. However, that's not a concern of mine -- as long as we do our best to help these people out. And I don't think there is a pilot or load master out there who doesn't feel the same.So please, think of the logistical impact multiple hurricanes will have on our logistical infrastructure before you run your mouth about how maddening it is these people haven't received any help.
I'm going to take a guess that the situation is a little more complex than us keyboard warriors think. I don't think our military will let 3 million citizens starve on that island. 
Anybody know how I can get there to help?  I'm electrical engineer with 5 years experience at an electric utility and currently do work in industrial automation.  P.E. Licensed in Illinois. Let me if you have any idea of who I could contact to get set up down there.I'd be willing to do anything from hand out food to clearing debris to managing construction crews.

I'm in the USMCR, the guys who are truck drivers in the civilian world are getting called up to go there as I guess the Puerto Rican drivers can't show up. Tons of supplies there though, just not really a way to pass it out. Opinion wise is the people who are there need to amass the locals to get the roads working so that trucks can run, there's a huge workforce there that's not being utilized, just need a good leader to get people together to clear paths enough to get the professionals in.
So many geography/infrastructure/politics experts in one place!
Please, we need help.
Alright. There are a lot of conflicting angles here. Lets see if we can focus this a bit please.We have officials on the ground saying the situation is dire, and that they need immediate help or there will be many lives lost, and that they are not getting even close to what they need. Simultaneously, Trump is saying they are doing a "tremendous" job on the relief efforts, and that theyre doing all they can. Both the Mayor of San Juan and Governor of Puerto Rico are being accused of politicizing and sensationalizing their comments in opposite directions; it is being said the governor is a suck up to Trump, and that the mayor is a heavy critic. These effectively discredit both of their statements, leaving the rest of us at a loss as to the real picture.This is further distorted and confusing because there is no power, and essentially no communication. Because of this we have little documented footage and accounts of what exactly is happening on Puerto Rico.What is the truth? Is Puerto Rico turning into an anarchy free for all? How much help is really available from the U.S. Government and how is it being distributed? Is this being exaggerated?If you have any insight or information to share to clarify the situation, please share.
San Juan is loaded to the brim with supplies. Problem is there are not any truck drivers to distribute. Also roads still blocked. Start sponsoring drivers to be sent out there and road clearing teams

Am I the only one who keeps reading "PR" as public relations? 
I'm on the USNS Comfort now.  We're on our way down to PR now.  Might not be San Juan.  But we got you PR.  Just a few more days.
Reading comments in this thread gave me cancer. I am now dead.
This thread = lots of really strong opinions on a situation about which no one actually has any idea what's going on
"Genocide" wow 
My grandmother lives in Puerto Rico. She and my friend have told me things that sound like a nightmare to me about how having no water or electricity is affecting them. Food is obviously a big problem and as other have stated lines for gas are ridiculous. In her neighborhood they have organized small meetings several times a week to coordinate how they can help each other. My grandmother is always cheerful, which I really find odd when bad things like this are going on, but I guess is a good thing as well. She‚Äôs refusing to come and stay with us because her dog needs care and probably won‚Äôt make it on a flight here.
I'm a police officer in Massachusetts and we're trying to help police officers in Puerto Rico but we have no idea how because we can't get in touch with anyone. What do we do?
yea but her backdrop is massive amounts of food and aid. So wouldnt it be better to allocate that stuff, instead of demanding more aid?
What if I want to volunteer my physical abilities on site is there a special convoy to get there? I'm in CA and can't afford the flight but willing to sacrifice a week or two helping these folks. 
When issue is the ports are full and logistics sucks on the island. Good luck. 
I really want to go and help. I applied to a security company to go to PR. I'm on a deployment list for when they allow non sworn armed practitioners to go. I have iraq and afghanistan combat tours(totaling 2 years overseas) in the Army(with a total of 6 yrs service), as well as experience extraditing fugitives and armed security at a court. Between all of that, there's no reason I can't go and help PR out. It's just a matter of who wants to help get me over there. A few security companies have contracts but right now their focus is getting sworn LEOs over first. More so then the high dollar amount they're paying security to go over there, I also care about actually helping the people of PR and wish there was something I can do.
My brother and his wife got stuck as tourists in Pr after the hurricane. They were just able to make it out yesterday on a cruise ship. They tried to book a flight out but the earliest they could get was on oct 10th. Finally hearing from them, it's insane to hear how horrible the situation is first hand.
We must help them any way we can!
I don't think there is anything Trump can do to magically restore the infrastructure on an island. They couldn't even get a lot of the first aid deliveries on shore because all the transportation infrastructure doesn't work. Like, try to unload a conex container without a crane. Bringing stuff to Puerto Rico right now is more like doing a D-day landing with no time to prepare than just moving things from point A to point B.
Electromechanical engineer here. I have a good deal of personal time I can take so I'd like to use that to help out. Does anyone know who I can contact to get more information on how I can get involved? I've donated money but money isn't what these folks need... they need people to help them re-establish their basic necessities (clean water, power and food).I can't seem to find much information on who to contact (specifically about helping rebuild their power grid). These people are Americans and they need our help (as do the victims of Harvey and Irma). Any information would be greatly appreciated.

 A possible logistical analog here might be the Berlin Airlift. The West supplied food, fuel, and other materials by air to keep 2 million West Berliners afloat despite a total blockade via land routes by the Soviet Union. Puerto Rico has 3.4 million people, and is 19 times the area of West Berlin. West Berlin had working infrastructure during the airlift and given that it was 185 square miles, nobody lived all the far from the airport. Puerto Rico is 3500 square miles of tropical and mountainous terrain with a completely collapsed infrastructure and blocked roads. At the height of the operation an aircraft landed every minute. Now, I know this isn't an exact analogue. We have ports in Puerto Rico, we don't have logistics left over from a recent war in the area, technology has changed, Puerto Rico is more geographically isolated, etc. My point here is to simply show how Incredibly immense the challenge is here by comparing it to a similarly immense logistical challenge. It's going to take extraordinary, once in several generations, next level logistics way beyond what you might see if whole armies were deployed to address the total food, fuel and rebuilding needs to sustain 3.4 million people.If the government is not ringing alarm bells on at least the order of the Berlin Airlift, they are probably off by an order of magnitude in their response.It's that bad. 
I'm so sick of the damn excuse makers here. Let me lay out some facts.In 08 my strike group went to assist in relief for the Philippines, we delivered 260 tons of supplies in like 5 days. We also helped restore power and a bunch of other shit. Most of you have no idea the actual capability of our fleet... The fact that there is two Navy ships off the coast and it's been over a week, that's a god damn embarrassment. I've been apart of two other huge humanitarian relief efforts from a carrier flight deck including Fukushima. I've seen what our Navy is capable of and what PR has gotten is a joke.We sent the USS Lincoln to help with South Florida but apparently sending a carrier to PR isn't as important as the main land of the US. There are three carriers in Norfolk right now that are sea ready. None have been sent.Beyond that we have CH53s that can external carry 8-10 ton payloads. We have V-22s that can external carry 5 ton payloads no problem. We have SH60s out the ass that can carry a couple tons each. I've fucking SEEN THIS HAPPEN with my own eyes and personally been apart of it. Yet when it comes to PR we sent two ships? (I know there are a couple more on the way now, FINALLY). If a carrier was there they could easily have 7-8 helo spots if not more on going at the same time coming in and out taking in tons of supplies.This is just a huge failure. I don't care how you want to paint it, this is a failure to respond. At this point we should have already delivered 1000s of tons of supply all over this island. You can easily fly at least 20 sorties a day per helo and even if they carried only a ton a piece... there's no reason supplies shouldn't haven't reached everyone by now. This is a massive failure and people will die because of it. Period.
I know that one unnecessary death is one to many and whatnot, but this mayor is saying WE ARE DYING! I am just wondering, how many people are dying in Puerto Rico since the hurricane hit? This is not a snarky comment, I am genuinely curious but can't seem to find any info on it....
If only we could all pool our money into a giant pot and use a small percentage of that money to help each other out when natural disasters like this take place.....Oh....yeah
So, how is this different from St. Martin and Barbuda? Are those islands ok? Or we just forgot about them. 
> "We have done an incredible job, considering there's absolutely nothing to work with," Trump told reporters at the White House.This sounds like Trump is saying PR is Fd and there isn't much he can do.
Honestly, I am hearing more about PR than I heard about Houston and Florida.  
There are 250 supermarkets open as of Friday.https://www.elnuevodia.com/negocios/empresas/nota/masde250supermercadosestanabiertosenpuertorico-2361820/
this is fucked. this gives you an idea how things could end up for all of us if a high scale tragedy occurred. when everything is destroyed, all the greedy people will see just how true it is that money can't just fix everything and keep them comfortable and safe from the realities that exist. if you're one of those people, you'll have a tough pill to swallow and you'll pray someone helps you when it comes down to survival.
I'm with a group of helicopter crew member/helitack firefighters that have just come off of some large fires and have nothing to do. Does anyone know who to contact to request a resource order to get deployed to help? Thank you!
People in US territories don't have a vote for the President, nor for anyone in Congress with actual power. Therefore, the federal government doesn't feel a sense of urgency to help. I have relatives who lived in St. Croix back when Hugo hit, they waited a long time for aid, and St. Croix is not a highly populated island like Puerto Rico.
Wonder how that vote for statehood will go next time around....
Would be a good time for Amazon and military drones. Send a crew down there to get as close as they can to neighborhoods with no roads and drop packages. Probably not feasible, just a thought.
The US would help, but it's an island surrounded by a lot of water. Big water. It's super watery. So getting help over is difficult, because of the water.

Hey, does anyone know if there is a Puerto Rico sub reddit for people trying to get information. We only got a quick check from two of my cousins but iI have a couple aunts in Maunabo that we havent heard from and I'm really worried.
I can offer my help if someone points me in the right direction to actually get a hold of someone relevant. I work in self sufficiency, sustainable (Permaculture) design. Making water potable, harvesting rainwater, growing food in deserts, arctics, and tropics.I solved our household water problem in the desert with water catchment and homemade carbon filters and plant systems. Their tropical climate is easy mode compared to my previous works. 
Sad part is those who want to help are starving and struggling too. 
If I was to hold a fundraiser in Pittsburgh what would be the best way to get money to where it belongs? Where would I send money? What is the best way to help?!
Any truck drivers need a plane ticket? I might be able to afford like 1 on a reasonable cost flight. Message me?
Why are people giving out so much gold in this thread? Can't you find any better place for your money to go???
As a fellow Puerto Rican, this breaks my heart. Puerto Rico is in shambles. A radio talk host called it "The Apocalypse of Puerto Rico", and my momma broke down. We have so much family over there and there isn't a soul we can reach. We heard that Quebradillas isn't too bad because of its mountainous landscape, but there are still some people dead and no help in my family's area. I pray that we get help soon, seeing my people hurting, crying in the fucking streets, gives you a whole different level of awareness for the problems these people have. Never again will I look at another disaster and the people hurting as an event that will soon pass. I'm sorry, Puerto Rico. I will be flying out there the minute I can to find you grandma and tio. I love you all so much.
I figured they were good to go.... saw a bunch of people on Facebook saying they were praying for Puerto Rico. Did that not fix it?
That's the most Miami football thing I've ever heard of
[Fumbles his mouth guard]...[Gives back chain]
On my beer league softball team if you strike out you have to wear a duff man costume until you get a walk or someone else strikes out. Basically the same thing, right?
I had to look it up, but it's not plastic. It's actually 10-karat gold: http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-hurricanes/fl-sp-um-turnover-chain-20170903-story.html
Point of pride for those boys.  Let um have their celebration 
Hopefully that chain wasn‚Äôt sponsored by Adidas.... lol
This is the most Miami celebration possible.
Better than a turnover trash can. 
7th Floor Crew
Why not Hurricane Chain?
Must've belonged to Ed Reed
Never change, U. We still got some things to sort out from 2001 and 2015 but god damn if you don't have the best reputation for being what you are and running with it
How long till the NCAA ruins this? 
If the Miami defense is any good this year that chain will have a high rate of turnover. I'll show myself out. 
It‚Äôs cool but I‚Äôm still salty as hell from getting our asses kicked tonight. All in good fun and something cool for a team to have. Wish Duke had something similar but oh wel

U SWAG IS BACK
This is pretty friggin wholesome. 
When I was starting out as a teacher one of the veteran teachers looked at me and said that I should go to the store and buy a bunch of stickers. Mind you I was teaching junior high school (11-14 year olds) and was a bit surprised at the advice. My colleague saw this and assured me that the kids (especially the guys) would love the shit out of them.Holy hell were they right. Kids go nuts over the smallest things and no matter how big they look, college kids aren't immune.
Its all about the U
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE U!!!
Most Miami thing ever. Love it.
Dats cool
That's my squad! GO CANES!!!
People often ask why I like college fb so much more than nfl. This is why! the tradition and unique aspects of ncaa fb make it so fun to watch and keep it unique!
Wow the NCAA isn't even trying to hide the corruption anymore! Coaches giving players jewelry on the sidelines DURING a game /s
Total football guy move
What if one player causes the fumble and another recovers?
Not a Canes fan, but that is pretty badass.
After watching The U on 30 for 30, I am completely not shocked.
UGA players get big gold spike shoulder pads on turnovers, pretty dope
Bama was the first one to start this trend with the championship belt, and it is still my favorite. 
Hey our guys do that! They love it too. Gotta make it fun.
How'd he go to the bathroom with all that stuff on? He OG'd! 
Imagining a QB fumbling the ball and recovering it himself, then going off the field after the play for a bit to wear the chain.
Probably a silly question but do they take it off before the next play? 
It‚Äôs better than a trash can
The Nike Adidas FBI Please Investigate Us Rick Pitino Memorial Chain 
I like that. A lot. 
Don't ever change, Miami
They need this at every job 
And this is why college football is better than the NFL 
God I miss football
Mr. T approves. 
I despise football passionately. Boring ass fuckin sport. 
I pity the fool that thinks they can make a forward completion..  
I'm so tired that the first time I watched this I saw the white kid turn black after putting the chain on lol.
Swags back
Positive reinforcement works at any age. 
 Most teams have some form of this either during games or after the games
That's awesome
Man my grandmama gave me dat chain!
I hope with that last name he earned his chain via interception 
datshytfye 
No one  gonna talk about how that first guy got punched in the face?
That better be solid gold
Haters gonna hate!!
lol that kid at the start
Mark Richt, why didn't you do that with the Dawgs?
Should give it to the guy who forced the fumble not recovered the fumble. 
Somewhere, Butch Jones is trying to figure out why a gold chain is cooler than a trash can
R/titlegore could have just said forced a turnover 
Sure is a questionable time in college sports to pull out the gold chain lmfao.. 
My Highschool does this with a wrestling belt
Financed by Uncle Luke?

Great chain! Way to go black guy!
Only the best chains for my squad 
That is crass, and awesome as hell.
i dont even really like sports, but this is great
So no one saw the white guy get hit in the face? 
Keep a gold chain on my neck, fly as a her, boy better treat me with respect.
thought it was a scene from the Ballers
RIP Sean Taylor
They stole that chain from Mr. T.
Mr. T must have been the best football player of all time!
I love how the thumbnail is a white guy, and the gif is like ‚Äúhah! Yeah right LOL‚Äù and immediately switches to a black guy. 
That's one way to summon the wild Aqib Talib...
That's a real 10 karat gold necklace. For anyone curious, a 10k gold necklace is about 42% gold, 58% something else. Not pure gold, but a cuban link with a charm like that can still be worth thousands of dollars.
I saw this and I wondered if it was like the PIMP stick that some other teams are using when they score (ITIW in a pro game)
I wonder how many times that chain has been entered into police evidence  
Well that's a chain-g of events
Eggball* thank you.
THE U! 
I knew Miami was getting an absolute steal in Richt.  Georgia lost they damn minds letting a 10 win per season coach go.
What if they're getting blown out would they still don the chain but just stand there sad?
If he gets two in a game, do they call him...*two chains*?
I'm a Virginia tech graduate. I hate Miami. This is an awesome thing they do
First the chain then a 8 ball
Bama has the ball-out belt... had it a while
How long has this been a tradition? Am I ok to imagine a Warren Sapp or Ray Lewis wearing this article? 
We've got like a fake title belt that we give to defensive players that get a pick six or fumble return touchdown. It's the turnover belt and they wear it all week, it's dope. 
Seems like a lot of teams have something like this now. 
I love it!
I love the college sideline turnover stuff. Tenn has the trashcan. What are some others?
Remove the rock of shame! Attach the rock OF TRIUMPH!
Way better than Tennessee‚Äôs trash can üòÇ
That person looks like a [character from Ballers, Ricky](https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/ballers/images/5/50/Ricky_jerret.png/revision/latest?cb=20150730172133) 
3 games into doing it. Welcome to the 2017 season...
It's like a 'good job' sticker 
This would be a 25 yard penalty and a 50,000 fine in the NFL. Have fun while you can 
Everything is amazIng when you're drink. <3 this guy for chains bro. P.s. I've made way too many commwnts from this toilet seat. 
Top ten for "we have exorbitant amount of money but can't pay players" SportsCenter highlight. 
Is it real? 
Unfortunate team name
And every year the person with the most turnovers gets to rob another local jewelry store for next year‚Äôs chain. It‚Äôs still better than FSU‚Äôs tradition of the star quarterback stealing crab legs from Publix.
The ideal of sportsmanship began to take a back seat to excessive celebration. The athletes caring less about executing the play than planning the vulgar grandstanding that inevitably followed, even the most pedestrian of accomplishments.
At UGA if a defensive player makes a great play they get to wear a set of spiked shoulder pads on the sideline, and at Tennessee if the defense recovers a turnover then that player gets to dunk the ball into a trash can when they get back on the sidelines.
They should rename it the turn up chain
What about the player that forces the fumble?  Isn't that more important than the person who recovered it? 
Anyone have a link to the full video? 
Go you, you aren‚Äôt that great. YAAAAAY!
80 on my wrist
Guy putting on the chain looks like he punched the white guy lol did anyone else notice that

I thought for a sec his name was "Pickney". It would have been perfect. 
This is oddly satisfying to watch.
Widely available in any dollar shops.
Is it real gold and do they get to keep , im assuming that he is cause of his reaction. 
Rewarding an achievement by a black with gaudy jewelry. Lmfao. 
Alabama does this with a huge wrestling championship belt

Not as cool as the turnover trash can
inb4 improper benefits
wonder if this was stolen from, or was stolen by Jim Scwartz (former HC,  now DC for the Eagles) whenever someone does something good, OR bad - they were a large chain link chain to show that theyre a piece of the greater good... play together etc.... 
But...but...So many Old Army Aggies are triggered that we used the "pimp cain" or the trash can to celebrate turnovers. It obviously causes you to lose. 
Silly bot
Sell that nonsense!^^^^^^^^.^^^^^^^^.You could probably get bail moneys worth for a few players at least.
Both "all for one" and "not everyone gets trophies" applies to life and in football. 
Nothing like bringing the "Gangsta" to a football game!
Bama has a belt.
Fools' gold. 
This is not football.
Alabama gives a wrestling style title belt.  Aka.. The alabama ball out champion belt. Better than fake gold :)
[deleted]
Stay classy Florida 
For a split second, the white kid thought he was getting the chain before being pushed aside. Hahah
So I think Miami started this fad this year and it's become a think for a lot of teams
I fucking hate that school
Yep, some schools have a championship belt that goes to the person who gets the turnover. There's one school that throws the football in a certain trashcan when they get the ball. Edit: thanks for the downvotes! Wtf? 
That looks more like something you have to wear if you fuck up. 
Uhh football? 
doesn't this count as an improper benefit?
"Pick me, pick me!" -pinnk ne
Gotta improve moral somehow right 
Pinckney & The Brain.....narph!
At FSU they get the same thing but the gold to make the chain was stolen from a Miami pawn shop
Never seen someone so excited over fucking up a play.
black culture strikes again.
Called the ballout belt at Bama
Gotta spice that knockoff bull shit up some how
Downvoted cause Go Noles
The NCAA would like a word about this gift.
Surely they don't pay their players.....
Everyone trying to be like alabama
They need to have a real gold chain. Get that fugazzi shit outta here
Not a single link to his said play, man fuck this thread.
Football is placing chains on black people... no wonder they're protesting. 
The quarterback who threw that interception probably took a knee shortly after this celebration. 
Keep proving stereotypes are real things. SMH
Is that lizard really mimicking the human or is it something else.
From last time it was posted This lizard isn't just simply imitating a motion. Arm waving is a [common behavior](http://www.thebeardeddragon.org/bearded-dragon-behavior.php) in bearded dragons, communicating recognition or submission. 
Holy shit. You just made first contact. Do not give him any weapons technology. 
Bearded Dragons are like the coolest lizards ever. My little brother has one, (which means now *I* have one because he sucks at caring for things,) and she just hangs out with you. She goes on walks with us, chills on your shoulder when you play games or watch stuff, for some reason all of our cats LOVE her. After a little bit of slow introduction, (slow because cats and lizards usually don't get along) they actually sleep with each other now. It's kind of fuckin adorable. 
Something about the way the lizard moves, the motion of the wave itself, is a little unsettling for some reason.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but I feel uncomfortable.
This made me as happy as the time I saw that gif of the pigeon saluting Putin 
I mean it would be rude if he didn‚Äôt wave back.
He moves like he's in a stop motion film. 
I used to have a bearded dragon named Squishy.I bought Ken doll clothing for him, including a top hat.He was the Lizard of Honor at my wedding.

Sweet pageant wave.
Instantly thought of bill and ted.
Hi-dilidy-ho neighborino 
That guy is the cutest little thing
This is a method of communication in many agamid lizards, including the bearded dragon. It indicates submission.
Today I made my first meaningful contact with the large pink being that brings me food. He waved his gargantuan arm at me and I waved back. I can only assume this is part of some complex mating ritual. I will gladly bear the children of my giant overlord. And I may eat them when I grow bored or hungry. 
Why does this lizard look so much like Dwight Schrute?
Looked like old school claymation 
Bahahaha. That's just darling!
I've got a turtle who responds to waving by paddling super fast.

#PRESTI CAN‚ÄôT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS
Congrats Thunder Bros. Y'all deserve him

RUSS STAY
Best player in OKC history

LOYALTY LOYALTY LOYALTY
God damn sam presti....a year ago everyone thought Russell's days were numbered. This fool actually got him to stay...
I want him to wear a solid gold suit to a post game presser
Build the statue now! Bulldoze that spot where kds restaurant is and put it right in the middle!
PRESTI FOR PRESIDENT
B-but LA.
Best news of a great off season.
This is great, really hope he gets a ring at some point.
"Demar Derozan is gonna go to the Lakers""Russell Westbrook is going to sign with the Lakers""Paul George wants to play for the Lakers""Lebron James may be planning to leave for the Lakers""Luol Deng"
THE KING IN THE WEST
About time
RUSS WESTGOAT
Nobody is going to the Lakers. Enjoy the blue balls you Laker fans get every year.LeBron is gonna stay too.
Nice. There's gonna a be a Brodie statue there when it's all said and done 
"Small market teams don't stand a chance in the NBA"Nah, the team you are a fan of is run by a bunch of dumbasses 
Good for OKC.
And this is the day that cemented that Russell Westbrook will forever be remembered as a God in Oklahoma City. Amen.
Me7o: Damn. I'm next
wow, gotta love guys showing loyalty, unlike a certain someone
Westbrook > Toby Keith
That "fuck you" money.
FUCK YES. On KD‚Äôs birthday makes it so much more satisfying 
I honestly couldn't be happier for the Thunder and Westbrook. It's a special thing to have a bona-fide superstar as important to the franchise as he as that is adored by the people and he loves them back.A guy with the same affection for the fans is what I want for Atlanta so badly. I'm happy to say that I will always cheer for the Thunder as long as Westbrook is there regardless of how the team is or who the other players are.
This is for all you people saying "just wait till PG and Melo and Russ all leave after this season and you'll have nothing"Suck it
Cleveland fan for life and I used to hate Westbrook, but I have nothing but respect for the loyalty he has for OKC. Happy for OKC fans.
THERE IT IS **Congrats to Brodie and OKC fans especially!!**
Pretty good summer for Presti, eh?
My hopes and dreams just crashed.
Best way to end the week. Fuck yes. Love the Brodie. 
An absolutely massive victory for small market teams. I hope this is a success and more players show loyalty over bright lights.  Plus 205mil ain't bad. 
OKC just announced today is Fuck KD Day. It's just coincidence if it's KD's birthday
He protecHe attaccBut most importantly...He sign big contracc
The Brodie about to become the GOAT. Great Oklahoman of All Time.
Bet he sent KD a text like "thanks for clearing up that cap space, man i just got paid"
OKLA-HOME
Russ got Loyalty in his DNA
I GOT I GOTI GOT
He gone after 6 years.-Lakers
So funny that KD was the one always talking about how he wanted to play for one team for his entire career and finish in OKC. People ate it up. Meanwhile Russ was always that guy that didn‚Äôt do much talking, and yet here we are ‚Äî he has done with deeds everything KD merely said as lip-service.
The hero OKC deserves.
Can I bet my life savings on Sam Presti being executive of the year? 
PRESTI OUT HERE GETTING SHIT DONE
This is officially the greatest offseason of all time
I've been a Laker fan for over 2 decades, so I'm disappointed that the chances of Russ coming to LA have significantly dwindled... but damn, I can't not like the guy for doing this. Love russ. Much respect.
It‚Äôs stuff like this that make me really regret choosing to not become a superstar basketball player.  
Lol same day I received a 51 on a math test! Russ and I just can't stop winning!
Get fucked KD lol
 IM NOT LEAVING *wolf of Wall Street gif*
A win for small market teams, way to go OKC!
I thought he was going to leave in free agency, so this is fantastic news.
Really seems like the best choice for Russ if he's all about his legacy. Winning a ring in OKC without KD would be huge for him. I also don't think there's a big difference in marketing opportunities between playing in OKC vs LA nowadays when you're a perineal MVP candidate. 
Russell and Lebron are the kings of doing petty shit and denying it as petty shit
I'm honestly happy with this just because it solidifies even more how much of a bitch ass snake KD is.
This seems like it might hurt the Lakers chances of getting Westbrook.
NO SUCH THING AS LOYALTY IN THE NBA? JUST ASK BRODIE
Imma take this opportunity to say FUCK THE LAKERS!!!
LOYALTY LOYALTY LOYALTY
Well here I was holding out that Westbrook would end up somewhere else. Now that he's staying, he against me!Hahah, but real talk, how is that man going to feel if PG and Melo leave next season? It'll be like they were never there *and* the team has less than before.
This man is making $78/minute. Not per minute of gametime. I mean per minute in a calendar year.
Lakers will never acquire a big free agent ever again lol
Guess he wasn‚Äôt lying when he said he only wears an outfit once.
Loyalty loyalty loyaltyyyyyy
SORRY LAKERS FANS THE KING OF THE PRAIRIE WILL REMAIN ON HIS THRONE 
That's approximately 410 Magic Johnson winks
Not a cupcake
Laker nation please stand down 
If they get PG to re-sign, holy shit
You can't buy loyalty from Westbrook. He has to accept you. And your $205 million.
Happy B'Day KD.
I think one of pg or melo will stay with okc, dont except all 3 to remain though
#I got I got I got I got
best off season of my life
This is the best day of my life!
Thank god i was actually getting worried
I LOVE YOU RUSSELL
Great off season for the Thunder. I had no doubt that Westbrook would leave because of his terrible talent around him. Then Presti goes and proves to him that they are a win now team.
KING OF THE PRAIRIE 
F U C K T H E L A K E R S 
So glad to see that. OKC has a fantastic fan base and now they don't have to worry about Russ. He's a demigod and I love to see  his love for the city/franchise
Good. I'm glad he thought of the people of OKC like a decent human being instead of only thinking about himself and taking the cash grab for more money than any six generations of human beings could possibly need. GG Westbook. 
Real talk, did he sign before or after he texted KD ‚Äúhappy bday‚Äù Hahahahahahaha
Happy for the Thunder fans. Sad for the Sonics fans
thats how its done.  fucc KD
This Offseason!!!
Damn but I thought Russ, PG, Melo, AD, DeRozan, KLove and LeBron were all conspiring to play for the Lakers!?! 
Brodie is the realest fuckin NBA player of this generation. Major props to the guy for going all in on the Thunder. 
OKC BOUT TO BE LIT
Triple double in finessing 
Sam Presti: Durant, tell me how my ass taste!
Presti kicking ass and taking names this offseasonI wonder how this affects our chances of retaining Melo/PG13
Be for anyone calls this a Woj Bomb, we have to credit who first broke this[Kanter Banter]
RIP haters, it's over. Who is your god now?
This offseason just keeps on coming
Imagine, you start to waken... you can hear the rain falling on the rooftop and outside. You can hear the wind in the air. You hug the blanket closer but it isn't enough. You crack your eyes open and look at your watch -- it's early. You brave the moment: you get out of bed to start the gas line to the fireplace. It lights in a rush and instantly you feel warmer. You jump back into bed, pulling the covers around you, already feeling the warmth seep through the blanket... it's going to be a good day :)
There would be a 100% chance I burn my foot on the fire place while getting out of bed. But it would be nice up to that point.
I'd be worried about the blanket touching the wood stove and starting a fire. D:
I can already see myself reading a nice book all cozy with a fire going. Suddenly I have to pee so I rush out of the bed, fumble and burn my ass on the fireplace. Screaming now, I'm grasping for anything for leverage to get myself off the ass toaster, slip and fall backwards into the window and then through it. I fall onto the charming cobblestone walkway outside and lose consciousness. Later people find me half naked with my ass seared to the bone and glass shards poking out of everything else and call for an ambulance. I wake up, it was just a dream! Nobody found me because I'm in the middle of nowhere and I'm still lying on that walkway with blood and glass everywhere. I promptly get up and fly away because I am now a bird. I follow my magnetic compass vision to the nearest car dealership and make a nest on the telephone pole across the street. I live out my life crapping on every new set of wheels to leave the parking lot.
More! More I tell you!
The only negative would be the hassle of changing the sheets.
I would never get out of bed. Well except to put another log on maybe.
Looks like Paul's room from Misery
Max hygge
As much as I love wood and wood panelling in natural colour on the first impression, i get bored with it very fast. I've stayed in chalets often and ended up relieved when i had to leave. Weird.
Changing the sheets would be a bitch.
It's not as inviting on a rainy day https://i.imgur.com/Cw1yJzI.jpg
You know that cozy/nostalgic feeling that you get that simultaneously sends chills up your spine but also makes you want to poop?Yeah, I get that from looking at this. It's lovely üòä 
What's going on under that wood stove?  
A nice rainy day playlist will just make the day! Some Bon Iver 
I would hump so hard in that room. 
/r/PlacesThatLookCozy
I'd stay up all night terrified that I was going to kick my blanket onto the wood stove.
everyone tried to warn Trump and his fellow Republicans about how shady Price was... instead, [they changed Senate rules to force him through anyways.](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/politics/republicans-vote-to-suspend-committee-rules-advance-mnuchin-price-nominations/index.html)> Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, pointed to the "extraordinary circumstances" surrounding the gathering and allowed the Republicans in the room vote to suspend the rules of the committee.> With the committee rules suspended, the 14 Republicans in the room voted to move the Mnuchin and Price nominations to the full Senate, even without the presence of a single member of the opposite party.
He was probably forced out as this can only become a larger story.
Tom Price is the latest contestant to leave The Apprentice: White House Edition.
Good riddance. Telling CDC they have to cut back or eliminate projects that keep people healthy, informed, and alive to save money, then spending $400,000 on your personal travel is fucking dispicable.
And in today's version of "Of course there's a tweet for that":https://twitter.com/RepTomPrice/status/20977565808> It‚Äôs an honor to be named a "Taxpayer Hero" by the Council of Citizens Against Government Waste for fighting on behalf of taxpayers.
From NYTimes:> "Mr. Price's resignation came barely an hour after Mr. Trump publicly dressed him down for the second time in a week and said he would decide whether to fire the secretary by the end of the day. "I'm not happy, O.K.?" the president told reporters before boarding a helicopter as he headed to his New Jersey golf club for the weekend.That's some brilliant journalism right there
$1M worth of taxpayer paid fancy travel is hardly the worst thing about Tom Price.He [made brazen insider stock trades](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/hhs-pick-tom-price-made-brazen-stock-trades-committee-scrutiny/) on healthcare companiesHis HHS department is doing everything they can to sabotage Obamacare, including literally [shutting down the website](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/353010-dem-reps-to-price-shorten-obamacare-site-shutdowns-during-enrollment-period) for "maintenance"He's a piece of shit, but only one piece of many in the Trump administration. Anybody that still buys into Trump's "drain the swap" rhetoric is a rube and and a sucker.Donald Trump's cabinet is [by far the wealthiest in history](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38168382)
Has any other administration had this many significant figures resign this early in the presidency? Asking honestly because I‚Äôm too lazy to look into it right now. 
>He previously apologised after making 26 private flights since May at a cost of $400,000 (¬£300,000) to taxpayers.Actually, he didn't.  He never apologized for his behavior, he was sorry for "distractions" and the "appearance".  Sort of like "I'm sorry you poor sheep are so deluded as to think that you can judge the actions of your betters".
He is the one who was actively trying to kill the NIH for some reason, even though a lot of his inside trading relied on research advances coming out of there: https://www.statnews.com/2017/03/29/tom-price-nih-budget/What a piece of shit.  Attacking the NIH should be the new 3rd rail
Turns out you can't put a Price on health mattersEdit:  a word
Who remembers how Trump was an expert at hiring the right people for the job because he was such a successful businessman?
But what about the guy who makes us pay for all those golf cart rentals? Did he resign yet?
& the dumpster fire burns a bit brighter. 
The guy abused his station and then bragged about it to tax payers who were footing his bill.  I can't believe people like there are being put in charge of our government.
There goes another corrupt, immoral swampdweller or "the best people" as Swampking calls them
I for one am getting tired of all this winning.
The Price is wrong.  Bitch.
He needs to reimburse tax payers for all of the $ that he wasted.
I just had a guy blame the financial collapse on Clinton and give credit for the recovery to Bush. 
> Hours before Mr Price's resignation Trump told White House reporters: "He's a very fine man. We're going to make a decision sometime tonight. He's a very, very fine man."  More evidence of his complete failure to understand basic values. A "very fine man" wouldn't even have considered making taxpayers pay for something so extravagant.
The house of tards is crumbling.
Breaks law, pillages tax payers, no consequences? Of course 
If you listen closely, you can hear the song "Leaving on a Jet Plane" being streamed by thousands of disgruntled HHS employees
**The fish rots from the head down.**All of them, Price and the rest of the profligate tax-money vacationers in Trump's cabinet (Pruitt, Zinke, etc.), thought they'd get away with it because of how fast Trump and his offspring burn through taxpayer cash going to this or that vacation locale for personal relaxation. Surely it was okay in Trump's new unaccountable America?That, "...I learned it from you, dad! I learned it from you!" meme seems very appropriate here.
[Republicans right now.](https://i.imgur.com/gJOQgnB.png)But no, this administration is stable!
Bwahahaha. Gee who would have thought a White House run by an incompetent brain dead reality tv star would be such a shit show. Nobody knew governing was so hard!
> President Trump had earlier said he was "not happy" with the expense.This is from the guy who is on track to spend more on travel in his FIRST YEAR than Obama spent in TWO FULL TERMS. Fucking hypocrite. But oh yeah, I forgot... Hillary's emails...
Pay us back now sucker.
Good. It's unreal the turnover rate in White House positions under the Trump Administration.
Good riddance you hypocritical piece of shit. Now for the rest of the shitstain administration.
Some ELI5, because I thought all of trumps expenses for staying in trump tower, for all of his family going everywhere all the time, hasn't that already costed tax payers more than $1 mil? Not trying to start a political fight with anyone, just legitimately want to know  
Just checked the_donald... couldn't find a thing on this. Wonder why.
Rich enough to get a taste of private planes but not rich enough to afford them himself 
He‚Äôs not a democrat, the rules are different 
I love how two of the most irresponsible people out there, Tom Price and Richard Smith (Equifax) are both just "Retiring" for their incredible fuck-ups.This country is such a fucking joke when it comes to executive accountability.
I work for HHS and get emails all the time from him which are really long and full of bravado about what he's been doing for the organization.  His resignation email was quite short.
Not even 5 o'clock. Guess the Price was wrong. 
ITT: Tons of shitty price puns.
This administration is a laughing stock. Goodness. 
Kind of remarkable. He was a twelve-year congressman. He was the chairman of some important committee. He was a member of the cabinet. Now he is just out of work.But the main thing is at least he did not have to fly commercial. 
Imagine, spending a million dollars of taxpayer money to fly all over the place and all it costs you is your job.Hey government, I'll quit my job if you give me a million dollars.
Another chapter added to the eventual HBO mini-series of the Trump Administration 
Another one bites the dust.
Whats the record for most resignations in a white house?
Now if only all the other corrupt members of trumps team would quit. Like, ALL of them that exist. 
Trump supporters: is this bad to you? Why or why not?
*I'll choose the best people for my administration!*
I loved how he only planned on paying 50k back for using 400k of tax payer money
He should have to pay back that fucking million in travel expenses...
He took a JetBlue flight home.  Guess its easier to charter flights when you can charge taxpayers. 
I'm not even focused on another resignation in this administration. I find it so much more interesting that a man with a net worth of 14 million decided it was a good idea to save his funds and fly on taxpayer money. In the same fashion, Steve Mnuchin, a man with a net worth of 300M, used taxpayer funds to go watch the eclipse.They have all this wealth saved up yet remain stingy hypocrites. Who in the world could actually believe that trickle down is a viable means to "boost the economy".? Their behavior is the norm for millionaires/billionaires. 
From the end of the BBC article>Interior department spokeswoman Heather Swift said in a statement that, as with previous interior secretaries, Mr Zinke "travelled on charter flights when there were no commercial options available".>"All travel is pre-approved by the ethics office before booking and the charter flights went through an additional level of due diligence," she said.Ethics Office Director Walter Shaub Resigned July 6, 2017, Saying Rules Need To Be Tougherhttp://www.npr.org/2017/07/06/535781749/ethics-office-director-walter-shaub-resigns-saying-rules-need-to-be-tougher
"hiring only the best" haha, Trump is a con man. All you suckers who believe in what he says are simply fools. 
I guess he wasn't a healthy fit...
Welcome to the Trump Administration where turnover is high AF
I don't think any administration has had so much turmoil so quick. 
I guess those flights weren‚Äôt worth the... cost
Good riddance asshole. 
Will the next swamp thing please stand up?
looks like the price wasn't right
Only the best, greatest people!
I can unfortunatrly name more of Trumps failed cabinet members than i can of any of Obama's.  I guess when departments like the HHS function properly they just aren't as interesting .
I wish I could steal a bunch of shit while working then quit and get in no trouble. Must be nice to be in the rich justice system and not the poor justice system.

Na na na na Na na na naHey hey heyGoodbye
And the castle continues to crumble, brick by brick. Thank God.
They're dropping like flies...and yet the queen bee still remains in the hive.
He isn't the only one abusing private travel. Looking at you treasury. 
doesn't matter.  total failure of an administration.  fortunately they haven't tanked the economy yet or started any illegal wars like the last republican admin.
Make him pay back every fucking dime.
I was told there would be winning?
I'd like to see Tom Price seriously investigated for the suspicious stock transactions and related legislation /regulation he was involved in that Preet Bharara was investigating when he was fired by Trump.  The entire administration is a den of thieves.  Luxury travel on the taxpayer's dime is the least of their crimes.
So he basically spent 1.4 million taxpayer's dollars then left.  Our government needs to send him a bill to reimburse us.
Price was just following in his bosses example.
Didn't he give up his seat for this in the House?
Trump is the representative of all Trump Supporters and so far the Trump Administration is a complete and utter joke. These racists claim to be superior yet they've shown all evidence to the contrary.
Surprised not to see some petulant quote from Price blaming "the media" for this. 
Price: Soooo, do I still have to write that check for $50,000?Trump: No! ffs. Even at the end you still don't understand. You just promise to make a donation. You never actually do it.
Is Trump gonna resign over his own expensive travel habits too?The Orange Hypocrite.
The Price is Not Right
Can we get an update on the running fire/resignation tally?
i love how this title handily ignores the scandal that drove him out, as if maybe he quit because he got a better offer at Sears. 
Those in the ethics office need to get fired for approving these flights 
The price is wrong bitch!
Gonna spend more time with his ~~family~~ money.
Hey Mr. health secretary you know what is bad for people‚Äôs health? Stress. You know why we‚Äôre stressed? Because we get taxed too much to pay for your damn joyrides. Just for tips in the future, the gas is on the right and the brake is on the left. 
The only regret he expressed in [his resignation letter](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/29/us/politics/document-Read-the-Resignation-Letter-Tom-Price-Sent-to.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=0) is that his extravagance attracted attention.
I had to endure the special election due to his leaving and he doesn‚Äôt have the wherewithal to last a year? As punishment I demand he only be able to hear the political smear campaigns that almost made me quit life
Pretty soon Trump is going to be mowing the lawn at The White House by himself.  Won't be anybody left.
Has there ever been this many people quitting/fired within a year of a new presidency (barring the usual Cabinet Switches?)I'm only 31, so I haven't been through many presidencies myself, but I'm sure this has to be unprecedented.
I think the dotard's cronies heard "drain the reserve" rather than "drain the swamp"
Meanwhile, in Canada they can check government officials' spendings on a website...
I wonder if this is the real reason why he was fired. The failure of health insurance reform as promised by Trump has been one of the greatest embarrassments of this administration. Trump came into office promising Much More Affordable Than Obamacare, cheaper drugs, everybody beautifully covered with pre-existing conditions all included and Tom Price was supposed to be his lead man in implementing this incredibly ambitious goal. Instead of which his main accomplishment was to be almost totally eclipsed in Kentucky without participating in the Derby. Helluva job, Pricey!
Too bad he wasn't related to Trump, then all these expenses wouldn't be an issue...like for his kid's ski trip.
Ohhh, so THIS is where the incredible amount of taxes I'm paying is going to, on these assholes private leisure trips. Not Hurricane Relief or working on our homeless veterans, or shit, even improving some of our major cities filthy water supply, but being spent on this dude so he can eat steak and lobster on a private jet. Making America Great again one $400,000 private jet trip at a time. 
Was that wrong?Should I have not done that?I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frowned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you people do that all the time.
Now we just need Jeff Sessions to quit, cause that guy... He just sucks. 
another example of the wealthy, being given, what one mentioned to me as the "Golden Parachute"Getting away with murder with things the average man would be thrown under the jail for.
Good riddance now get rid of Priut 
>Mr Price had promised to repay the cost of his seats on private flights, saying: "The taxpayers won't pay a dime for my seat on those planes."Where  did he get that money that he is going to pay back the US taxpayers with?
I just don't get why they keep doing it like this
I have the best administration folks, the best.
The Price is wrong, bitch. -Bob Barker  -Michael Scott
Words of wisdom from my dad: the best beer in the world is the one offered by a gracious host. Doesn't matter if it's Blatz. Thankfully drink it.This philosophy has served me well over the years.
And yet you'll order Grey Goose and scoff at cheap vodkas, whereas grandpa uncle's backyard "generic vodka" still was doing gangbuster business in '29.
Been smoking weed for 12 years, and still don't even know wtf kush is. To me, there's always just been good weed, and bad weed. They both get you high
To be fair, this is common practice with alcohol preferences and no one really cares. I work at a bar and I hear some rendition of: "nah, I'm not a tequila person. I prefer whiskey," at least a couple times a night. Body chemistry should be considered for any drug, really. Sometimes I think people being more educated about weed strains would be good because there would be less negative experiences overall. All that being said....smoke the damn joint, dawg. 
That's why I only do Cocaine
Sativas make me paranoid. Indicas make me forget my troubles.I don't care if it hurts your feelings, Ill pass on sativa and never regret it.
The marijuana industry is encouraging it.Call me crazy but at a social gathering I just want some outdoor grown mid level weed where you can roll up a blunt and pass it around a few times and everyone isn't high off their ass and can still actually communicate. Like the shit we smoked in high school. 20% THC? Nah I'm good with 5% thanks.
Holy shit I thought I was the only person in the world to run into someone like this at a party a couple weeks ago. "How old is this? It tastes like some shitty 2 month old weed. I don't smoke anything that was harvested more than 3 weeks. My brother grows so I know good weed from bad."Go fuck yourself dude.
This actually happened tome on a long road trip. Fired up a joint & passed it back only to be met with questions about the strain. It's pot & we have fuck all to do for the next 10 hours. You want some or not? 
Well, indica wouldn't be the type you'd want at a party anyway, it zonks you out. Sativa makes for a more energetic buzz.
That OG Kush will put some folks right to sleep, man that stuff is some heavy Indica, but I like it, doesn't make me sleepy.  And it's the best thing I've found for pain, it will kick a stomach ache and most other pain, straight to the curb.
Uh, bring it on. I feel like people don't get how thoroughly they've been brainwashed by prohibition.  "Hey bud, want a drink?" "Uh, what kind?" "Whddaya mean what kind? It's alcohol! That's all I need to know!" 
I mean not to defend snobbery, but lets face it, there are some strains that just don't agree with certain people. And if you're conscious of it due to experience then I would say it's OK to politely decline. I mean you would hopefully know this sort of thing as a host offering, and not be offended in the first place...
[deleted]
Ah, Portland.
Think of it in terms of alcohol and you'll probably understand it a lot better. There's a difference between being offered Guinness and Pabst. There's a difference between being offered Rum and being offered scotch.Etc. Etc. Etc.I won't even touch some booze, while i'll gladly chug other types.
After moving to the Pac NW, I totally get this! A few months after getting here I caught my nearly 40 year old husband make an annoyed huffing sound as he tossed a $10 joint in the trash because it wasn't organic... Our college-age selves would just stare at us in wonder seeing how much life has changed.Edit: a word
Yall are just ignorant. Certain strains alleviate anxiety. Other strains can induce panic attacks in certain people. Some people know what works for them.
There are huge differences between Indica and Sativa. Not defending the guy, but people are really picky about their weed and different weeds effects you differently
I also prefer some blue cheese over OG kush any day.
nobody should care what drugs they do or how they make them feel.
Who the fuck would want to smoke an indica at a party?
I‚Äôm all about that Romulan 
As annoying as some people can be with this, there are some people that CAN'T have certain strains. I know quite a few people  (including myself when I smoked) that cannot have sativa or sativa based hybrids. It causes pain and inflammation in some people.  Just saying. 
There were weed snobs long before it was any kind of legal. Though if anyone says they can name a strain off scent they're not just wrong, they're stupid. The same strains can very so much in scent, and even taste, from how they're grown. Not to mention unless it's a clone it won't be 100% the same genetically.
Do you want caffeinated breakfast tea or sleepy chamomile? 
Can confirm. Just got back from Oregon. I met many people that I literally couldn't share a toke with for this reason.  
I'm not drinking fucking Merlot!
Who brings indica to a party? This guy knows his weed. 
My only rebuttal to this is that I freak out with too much thc. So I really am picky about the weed I smoke. I need cbd heavy strains. 
I dont really smoke weed, but wouldnt it be like beer? I mean I dont like Bud Light lime but if I was offered one, I wouldnt turn it down. 
As a resident of a major wine region, I have heard this sort of thing said about wine for years. Recently I have heard it said about coffee, and it doesn't surprise me that it is said about weed now. It is often a load of shit spouted by tossers that want to sound important, but there are also some very interesting facts that can make your enjoyment of weed/wine/coffee much better because you learn to know what you like and can make informed choices.In cases like this, a simple "no thanks" is all that is required. The other added shit is just to make them sound important. IMO the time to talk about the strain is when you are offering it, "here try this, this is a <strain> that will give you an <effect> type of high."
I asked a guy at the weed store for a comparable strain to one they sold out of and he replied. "I don't know man. I don't smoke flowers. I only smoke concentrates."
That's definitely been a thing for a while in Denver. I can kind of get the sativa/indica thing, but the strain snob stuff is just silly. 
I mean I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs a bad thing if you politely decline. Just don‚Äôt be an asshole. Different strains have different effects. Maybe I don‚Äôt want to be sleepy on a couch. Just like how one might prefer jack and coke over a dry red wine. 
I‚Äôm sorry that most sativas exasperate my anxiety. I usually stick to indicas. Don‚Äôt mean to be a douche but not thanks? 
Took 3 huge hits of sativa the first time and passed out for 6 hours. Wtf is in that shit?
ITT: People acting exactly like the meme.
I still will turn it down because I have to smoke low thc pot... the amount of thc in this stuff nowadays is insane!
If utilizing an ability to recognize the distinct differences between how different mind-altering hallucinogens affect my ability to think and socialize makes me a hipster, then so be it. Weed is nothing like alcohol.
Are you saying people can't have preferences for pot, like, oh... wine drinkers?I prefer sativa, but would smoke other strains if that's all that's available. But I don't shit on people if they have a strong preference for what they smoke. Edit: Let's keep in mind that we're assuming OP is relating the incident just like it happened. I mean, people don't post strawman arguments on reddit just to start a ruckus... right?
Lol smoking a joint.. You haven't experienced *real* weed until you've breathed it in through a bag, straight off the volcano. /S I guess.
The best and only response to this is "ok, douche"
Maybe he doesn't want to be couch locked? Be glad we can choose now.
Hipsters ruin everything.
I just don't like the way an indica makes me feel. I'm down with a hybrid or straight sativa. I won't be a dick about it though
... weren't these people always a thing?
Just like the beer snobs right now.
Think of indica and sativa like white and red wine. Everyone has their preference.
this was me at one point and i didnt even realize it. im super into knowing my strains, and smoking something specific for specific purposes lmao.plus, why would you smoke an indica at a party anyway smh
The only weed I really liked talking about in detail was when I had a few plants going and finally got to reap the rewards. I gushed about it as I got as many people to try it as I could.Other than that, keep passin' it to the left.
Never turn down free weed. Unless it's bullshit reggies. But I do prefer sativas. 
Fucking hipsters ruin everything. Also chances are they never smoke weed anyways. 
Everyones talking about beer and im over here smoking my cheddar cheese sativa. 
I feel like the strain is just made up 90% of the time and nobody can really tell the difference.
"I only smoke DMT, weed is too mainstream."
I'll always hit the joint, but only one hit if it tastes like pesticides or shwag
well to be fair.. indicas do suck. I've smoked for 20 years and it's not being trendy or some shit it's just sativas are a much more enjoyable high for some people. 
I have a cousin who is an "organic farmer", she is like this but gives me free weed, so I am not really complaining just bragging. 
I haven't been able to tell the difference, personally.
I don't smoke indica though. And yes I can tell by smell if I want to smoke someone's weed. 
This has always existed.
I very much look forward to this day as a New Yorker. Plus, you can smoke Satvia and still get shit done.
I‚Äôm not going to lie. I do prefer sativa to indica but I‚Äôm not going to turn down an indica joint if that‚Äôs all that‚Äôs available. 
I used not to give a shit until some strains started making me really sick so I researched every strain I tried. I've found hybrids were the best for me and been sticking to it for a while now.
The only thing that sounds worse then stoner culture is adding hipsters to it
I mean.... I get it...
well I mean, indicas will generally knock me on my ass so I'd prefer a sativa
I might get downvoted but fuck it. I think there's differing atHC levels and differing states of mind/ environments. I think the whole induce sativa thing is bunch of BS. Especially when you consider that a lot of the strains now are hybrids being marketed as one or the other.. 
What happened to just weed.  People ask me what kind is that? There's only two types, weed and the good weed. 
Hey. If that type of culture made beer better, it'll make weed better too. 
Shit it's opposite for me, I'm a field guy for an engineering firm usually about 75 percent field work and the other 25 percent is office work. The days I'm in the field my back feels great even if it is lifting heavy stuff, bending over etc. The days when my back bothers me most are days in the office, sitting for more than an hour at a time fucks my body up and I mean everything.
I had a guy actually say that to me once, well except the Midol part.  My reply was, "No, actually, my back *still* hurts from a terminal velocity impact with the ground.  It hurts every day, no matter what I do or don't do, and has since late January 1991."His response?  "Oh."  
I have a disease that causes lots of lower back pain and I still do a lot of manual labor. Let me get that guy a wig.
I've done both. Programming all day makes me more tired than hard physical manual labour (which I've done for days in a row from waking to sunset).Anyone who says either job is easy is ignorant of the requirements.
That guy has back pain just from being a lardo. 
Back injury 4 yrs ago this month (company decided our rig didnt need any offsiders as they were going broke, sacked 80% of them, and made us drillers offsiders). Swinging 14kg sledgehammer for 2 1/2hrs in awkward position whilst removing 8 3/4" drill pipe, heard & felt a pop in lower back- L5-S1 disc had completly collapsed. Over an hour drive back to town through the Aussie bush...First surgeon was akin to the Butcher of Baghdad, managed to fuck nerves, cut muscle in a weird way. Second surgeon fixed those fuckups, and did a fusion with a cage.If i move all day, pain is manageable. If i sit, lay or stand still too long, thats me fucked.Back pain fucking sucks, especially when it is chronic.
Ok, so midol is actually great for back pain, even for non period related pain.
I choose to read this as wholesome. "thank you, sir, that is very helpful of you"
I dispatch for an HVAC company and enjoy telling my guys when they get lippy that I'm going back to my temperature controlled office. It usually turns what might have been a conflict into fun banter where we poke fun at each other. However, we both know that I wouldn't last a day in the field with the temps they endure, and that they wouldn't last a day with the high pressure whirlwind that is my daily work life. Because we can respect that, we can have fun at each other's expense without minimising the reality of the jobs we do. More people need that mentality. Every job has a stressor, and everyone will handle those stressors differently. Why mock those that handle something differently than you? 
you can tell op's the one who wants that midol for having back pain 
If that dude wasn't out of shape as shit he might not hurt his back carrying that foam or fiberboard or whatever (blurry photo). If you're "work" strong, but have a giant gut, guess what? You are not in good shape.
I would rather be a physical laborer than have 4 fractures on my spine.
Can't both of their backs hurt, for different reasons? Fuck you.
I work construction, work fixes my back from sitting on my arse all weekend.Let me take those sheets off ya mate.
My back hurts worse from sitting in an office chair all day, than it does after a day of manual labor. 
Proper form and lifting techniques will save your body.
Pretty sure his back is from his overweight stature and now the single piece of plywood he's holding 
If he had one of [these](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Stanley-Panel-Carry-Orange-93-300K/202262083) it would make his life easier. Work smarter not harder...
I've worked both. I have more back pain and bodily aches at my desk job than when I did manual labor. Fortunately I have a flexible schedule and I can go for a walk when I need to. 
My back is usually more sore from playing games a lot, than from playing hockey or working
19 years old with horrible back pain because of a twisted ass spine and it's only going to get worse. I have so much to look forward to. 
Oh fuck, excuse me for my scoliosis and poor lumbar support!
As a super active dude that has had a couple back surgeries for chronic, genetic bullshit: fuck whoever made this meme. 
Yeah, fuck my scoliosis and pinched nerves! That means nothing because I'm not a manual laborer. Could some one tell that to me back pain? It doesn't seem to want to listen to me. 
Have worked at a desk and worked at a lumber mill. Fudge this mess! No way in hell sitting at a desk is even close. Anyone saying they felt better working physical labour probably wasn't doing masonry or roofing.
physical therapist here. the majority of patients i get coming in for back pain are office workers or women who work with small children. People who sit or bend all day are far more prone to back pain. 
People really love to be a victim, for some masochistic reason. How bout we all shut the fuck up and just do our jobs? TY
Y'all need some r/ddpyoga
ITT:  People who have never done physical labor
I wonder if he knows that sitting all day is the one of the best ways to fuck up your back.
Didn‚Äôt know my dad‚Äôs friends were super active online
ITT: people who don't work manual labor.
And when your brain hurts from thinking, I'll let you nap in my Model X. 
I thought Midol was only for period cramps lol
I have a question. Is this whole sub basically calling people out for the 'no true Scotsman' logical fallacy? 
Doesn't back pain only happen when they pick something up the wrong way? 
These sheets lol
And then there's being in the military. I'm 19 with back pain. Shoulder pain. And knee pain. My hips don't hurt yet though! 
Drywall repair guys, the manliest men in the universe
I went from plumbing to marketing. My body has gone to shit.
Wow, so tough.
Wow how considerate! 
He's carrying those wrong.
Back pain from undeveloped back muscles in the office space is do ridiculously common. Not sure why it is mocked.
Ironically if your back is hurting from labor like this, you need to learn how to pick stuff up properly.
I was a mason before I became a software engineer. I was less exhausted at the end of the day as a mason.
As this tells me his your back pain is less than mine.   
Sitting for long periods of time is terrible on the lumbar vertebrae.
If their back hurts they're most likely carrying things wrong :/
My back is sore from a hard work out. Why don't you put those sheets down and this keyboard jockey will show you how to lose those 40 extra pounds, ya dumb fat fuck.
After you get that Midol, put on a bra.  That'll help your back.
Didn't realize Reddit was 50% manual laborers nowadays. 
I've worked construction for a decade after high school and during university. I've worked 16 hour days of manual labor, shifts longer than 40 hours straight at times. Everything from shovelling/finishing asphalt and concrete, to hand digging for underground, to operating loaders, rollers, and pavers. Now that I'm doing engineering/management, I can say sitting for extended periods of time is much harder on your back than manual labor. I spend most my time in the office or driving to sites now and my backs never been worse. I'm also in shape and quite athletic, but my daily slouching has caused my disks to weaken and herniate after lifting and training MMA. It's one of the hardest things to correct too because unless you're lying down for 24 hours a day you can't deload and rest your back.The absolute worst is driving/operating equipment. Especially if it happens to vibrate like an asphalt roller.  I couldn't imagine the damage to your back operating one of those for 10-20 years would do. 
Lifting heavy shit (with proper form) ain't so bad on your back. It's my wrist that usually cry uncle first. That and bending down for the 50th time that day.
Rotate the hand on the lower grip. Take the weight on your arms. 
Your back hurts from bad form repeatedly, like bending a piece of metal till it breaks. Thats why you generally hurt it doing something easy. 
i framed houses for 10 years. carrying a sheet of 1/2" plywood, or 3 at the same time isnt hard on your back if you know how to lift and carry properly and your body has gotten used to it. ive been at a desk for most of the last 8 years, body has never gotten used to that. so, shit hurts for no apparent reason. age, not moving nearly as much isnt good for the bones. going to the gym every day helps but nothing beats keeping your ass in shape like labor. too bad its generally less pay than desk jobs. 
I think people who talk like this are just jealous they weren't smart enough to pursue an office job.Also I'm a concrete finisher, I am too dumb for an office job.
I do a labor intensive job now, but I'm switching to office work (need better money, and I want more of a mental challenge), but I am extremely worried about my back moving to a desk job. We're meant to use our bodies, not turn them into a bag of jello. 
My guess is whoever made this is a lazy slob of a teenager who wishes he was a farmer or something but is too lazy. I'm a fitness coach/trainer and office workers have the worst back strength, mobility and pain of any other clients. Especially ones in lower wage office jobs sitting at shitty chairs all day and less freedom to walk around throughout day (call centre etc). labourers in my experience have fucked up knees, hips and shoulders more so than back. Any decent labourer with good lifting technique will have a fairly solid back. 
Back when I use to work at uhaul, I had the job task change on me when from working outside to work indoors with customers. One day I was heading home as the newbie was taking off an AT from a customers car. He had a hard time taking it off. I ended up one arming it with no glove and walked away. Didn't realize how dainty new people could be till I saw that.
Drywall isn't even terribly heavy it's more cumbersome, at least use a picture of a guy carrying sheetrock or a bag of cement.
Let me also get you a tampon for that vagina of yours to stuff it before you get too much sand in there! 
Idiot in the pic is carrying it wrong.
I had more issues with my back working at a call centre than I did working in a shop where every morning it was my job to be moving and putting out the heavy meat/day pallets, and where due to the layout of the freezers you couldn‚Äôt lift things safely into position.
Hard labor all day is better for your spine than sitting all day...as long as you lift with your legs.
I hate when people say that. So what if I'm young? My back hurts not because of age, but because I'm 6'6"
I'm a stripper. I spend 10 hours a day in seven inch heels. I am given no training on proper posture, hand holds, kneeling or balancing and I am expected to teach and police myself on what is healthy for me versus profitable. I use a four inch diameter spinning brass pole and centrifugal force to lift and pose my body in various ways. Often, I hold on with only one hand or just a patch of skin normally hidden by my underwear. I crawl, kneel and roll around on a floor usually made of solid wood or granite. I am not allowed to wear knee pads or comfortable, safe shoes. "Safe" means I tie them on with extra laces.   I have a shit on the body job. People think all we do is walk around and look pretty but for those of us in it for the long haul, we put our bodies through a lot and ask you kindly to look past the bruises that it takes to lean all the way forward on a hard chair to get my tit in your buddy's face when he jerked back at the last second.  We aren't taught the correct way (if any) to support our own body weight plus the g forces on the pole. We just grab on and put it all on our wrists and push our ankles towards our knees and torque that weight up. After 12 years I really feel it when I have a busy night. Dry humping is hard.
Get education, get a better job, physical laborer. 
On the other hand, you're not likely to mess up your rotator cuff working an office job. Source: Construction worker who messed up his rotator cuff at work.
My brother is like this about everything. He works second shift and I can never even mention being tired or he loses his mind. 
That just looks like sheet rock.
Nurses and CNA's can blow their backs out from lifting people up in the bed.  A few have where I work and can't lift anything ever again without excruciating pain, they had to quit work. 
As a guy that suffered vertebral fractures and developed kyphosis and subsequently lumbar lordosis, I'm just going to throw out some back pain management tips:If you have back pain from sitting or lifting too much you need to exercise, stretch, use spinal traction techniques and practice correcting your posture. The spine compresses when you force it into positions for long periods and then it doesn't always want to bounce back to its normal shape. You have to help it by stretching and putting yourself into positions that produce traction. If you do it right, it's not always a pleasant experience, but the results are sweet relief. I also do a multi-mile hike with a 35lbs pack on my back almost weekly, sometimes multiple times a week  in order to strengthen my back muscle and my core muscles. The first few weeks I did this my back was in a lot of pain. Over a couple of months my pain while hiking went away. And so did most of my other back pains in general. So, trust me when I say this....exercise, stretch, spine traction & work on your posture. The results aren't going to be over night and you might actually experience more initial pain. The results, however, are entirely worth it. 
He needs to learn how to carry heavy stuff without hurting his back.Also core strength buddy, its all about that core.
Washed cars in Phoenix for 5 years, rear ended by semi truck on off-ramp, got computer science degree, work at desk... threw back out taking out trash. Originator of post can go fuck themselves. 
More shitty carpenter memes
Yeah in my job it hurts more when I have to stand in the same spot, much better moving around
I was a physical labourer for ages, and now still working a physicalally taxing job. The only time my back hurts is when I'm sitting at a desk for too long.
The guy in the picture looks over weight. You may be able to lift heavier things, but I'll probably outlive you.I actually see this all the time in the gym. The biggest guys in there always have guts as well. They may be big, but they don't necessarily look healthy to me. 
I think the worst part is the guy carrying 
"My hard work is more valid than your accounting job" üôÑ
The guy is holding the sheet in a very stupid and ineffective way. 3/10 sheet holding skills
Desk jobs are hard too! Today I accidentally cut a tiny chunk off my thumb while using the paper cutter. Shit sucks man
I really don't see this as gatekeeping....its more like the truth. Back pain from labour intensive work is far worse then getting sore, sitting in a chair for too long.You guys are calling this dude fat and shit, and that's why he has back pain?? Fuck right off. Every size and shape of people that I've worked with in the trades have at one point had serious back issues. I've worked the hard labour and also as an estimator, sitting in a chair all day. I can tell you from experience, sitting in the chair for too long made me sore, but to compare that to pain from hard labour is really dumb. 
Why can't people who do real work make fun of Pansy's who sit at a desk ?Serious question. Isn't this just gatekeeping in itself ?
Even when I halfassed in labor jobs I stayed thin. This guys a liar. Get him some midol. 
>a laborers'*laborer's 
apes were never meant to stand in the first place.. as our brains developed after we started standing up, evolution took us down this path. knee pain, back pain.. both side effects of pushing our bodies to limits they were never meant to push.. that's why both are so common. we're meant to be knuckle-dragging-crouchers.. evolution just brought us to strange upright positions because the benefits outweighed the bad shiti know this is blowing past the obvious 'gate keeping' here, just blows my mind with how much we push our bodies to live 'normal' lives 
It's also a fat ass problem.Lose weight you fat shits and you wont have back problems. 
Wow, your back hurts carrying drywall...my husband is a weldor/fabricator so HE carries METAL...And YES welDOR is correct, a welDER is the machine...I am a secondary double gatekeeper, soooo..... I think I win?! Didn't think I needed this /s...
That looks like a gaylord to me.They're big foldable cardboard boxes. We use them where I work regularly and theyre like 20lbs max. The only way you could get back pain from em is if you carry them like the guy in the pic.
if this faggot played games he'd know sitting around for hours on end is way worse than lifting ONE sheet of some bullshit cardboard
Why is a white guy carrying that?  What happened to the illlegak?

Hands down one of the best episode of the series. 
This was, at least to me, the best episode of Rick and Morty of all the seasons.
You got that from film theory or another post here. 
Repost Rick? 
Still, nothing on the rent yet...
The Rick is too damn high.
I thought my fellow Rick and Morty fans were of higher intelligence, wubba lubba dub dub
Oh yeah! Wasn't he called something like 'too many ricks'?

I love the detail on the tie too.
Literally a few hours after the episode, someone posted about this.
Better late than never.
Your response time is too damn high
Seriously though, are we SURE that's not Samuel Jackson?

Considering the fact that there were tons of posts about this, you just now "realized" this? Come on... Just write "I want karma" and be done with it.

So many sweet internet points I missed out on.

So has this sub like 20 times already
Really just realized? It was pretty obvious. 
I just wanted to say was; "no shit," but I couldn't. It didn't feel ethically right. 
Mentioned several times in both comments and posts. I'm a bit disappointed OP. However, how could I ever downvote Jimmy McMillan? Have my upvote :)
Little late
Duh, I thought this was obvious.
I also watched today's film theory.
Are you fucking kidding me?
you JUST realized this?
You only notice it now and get almost 6k upvotes? Holy shit this sub really is desperate and will upvote anything.

Just surprised he didn't say "noone knew getting aid to an island could be so difficult." 
His mental faculties are clearly in decline. I mean he was no Einstein before, but it seems that every time he speaks it's a little more stupid. 
"Big Water"? What the ever-loving fuck kind of drugs are you supporters doing to continue with this embarrassing charade of defending this idiot? Is there anything so incredibly stupid that President Dumbass could say that will ever convince you that his head is full of beans and gravel? I know it's hard, I'm sorry, but _you voted for the biggest moron that ever held public office_. 
Someone should tell him about Hawaii.

Nobody knew an island is surrounded by water
I teach at a middle school that is something around 60% puerto rican kids.  How the fuck am I supposed to explain this?  I'm going to get questions.  I try to stay neutral, but how the fuck am I supposed to explain that asinine statement away.  Our president is such a fucking moron I can't explain his idiocy away to children.edit; "and we'll be there every day until that happens." 'or until the weekend when I head to one of my golf resorts.' god I hope this sack of shit has a fucking stroke this weekend.

Wait until he learns what an archipelago is; it's gonna blow his mind.
To be fair, he does have to explain it this way to clarify these complex concepts to his half-wit base.
Nobody knew islands could be so complicated. I wonder if he was surprised to find out it's part of America too.
Is... is he actually retarded? My four-year-old speaks more coherently than this.
YUGE water!
He is staggeringly stupid.  It beggars belief.  To think that almost half of the American electorate judged this man to be worthy of public office.  There are no words.
He also cited debt as making relief complicated. Nevermind the amount of taxpayer dollars he spends on the SS, guarding Trump towers.
I watch from my country, and think to myself every day...how is it possible that you Americans voted for this bumbling idiot.  He's CLEARLY retarded.  You elected a fucking retard.  
Well...he's not wrong, or lying.Yup, that is the standard for this president. Pointing out that an island is surrounded by water.
Fake news. Everyone knows Puerto Rico is part of Mexico and Mexico  is that big scary place with all the rape and drugs underneath 'Murica.

I can't even. He's just so fucking dumb. Seriously. We elected a man who can't put together a coherent thought or complete sentence. Wtf.
"I have the best brain."
Nature's got a problem with humanity:**H**arvey**I**rma**M**aria
This is so stupid I can't even come up with a clever response. Sheesh. How in the fuck did 62 million people vote for this guy!? 
I think Trump and Buster Bluth took the same cartography class
Makes W look like a god damned genius
>"Ultimately the government of Puerto Rico will have to work with us to determine how this massive rebuilding effort ‚Ä¶ will be funded,"Sounds like a chef asking a goose how it wants cooked.
'Big Water' is how my 2 year old son refers to the ocean.
He has to stick to words that his devotees can understand.
I feel like he showed up to speech class and forgot his notecards.
Big water...bigly...the cyber...covfefe...the Trump lexicon is truly a thing of wonder.
He is a moron. 
Trump University education paying off.
Big bada boom! 
He‚Äôs got the dumb. 
My god, my god, why have you forsaken meJesus fuck this is the worst timeline.
Wait so I knew it was an island and I was pretty sure it was surrounded by ocean water. I think I remember a science teacher saying oceans are big, but I woulda never thought Puerto Rico was an island surrounded by water, big water at that, and to top it all off OCEAN WATER!!! Mind blown
"The water...is..very wet."

At this point I'm rolling my eyes so hard that the force of them rolling back into my skull is causing me to do back flips and die.
I want to get off 45's Wild Ride.
#OCEANWATER
He'll probably divert some of the ships to help with the ongoing search for Nemo.
It's bigger, it's Ocean water.

We can thank the Rust Belt States for this fuckin‚Äô embarrassment. 
Is nobody else incensed about the part where he implied all the Puerto Rico police and firemen are sitting on their asses doing nothing?
WTF is big water?How the fuck did this guy become president?
The IQ of a nut
This is BIGLY
Maybe he's just afraid of the ocean or can't swim. 
Actually, uh, that's an acceptable nautical term, for high seas and long crossings. I doubt he *knows* that, but he's technically not out of line on his word choice. Still, who would have thought an island would be surrounded by water?? 
come on mr trump! we have to cross the big water before the bigtooth gets us.please move mr trump there's so many treestars over there 
The unconscious master of dumbing it down.

He‚Äôs clearly an expert on Puerto Rico. 
God please let this man be losing his marbles so he can get the fuck out 
It's beyond ridiculous.  What fucking jack off asshole.  Bringing up the debt situation during this is off the charts insensitive.  It would be like George W two days after 9/11 saying "We'll find these terrorists who did this.  They will hear all of you!  But, the bathrooms and elevators in those buildings were terrible".
Nobody could have known how deep the ocean was!
Donald Trump, President of the Tautology Club.
Having a president who is as dumb as a brick sandwich just is not amusing anymore. 
He's actually retarded. American elected a retard. 
"Water, big water." - 3 year olds    - POTUS
Trump's supporters: "Damn, he smart!"
Not just any water: Ocean water.
::Picard face palm::
I think he is unwell, mentally. His personality aside there really does seem to be something wrong with him.
The more horrific part of this story is burried behind his idiocy:> "Ultimately the government of Puerto Rico will have to work with us to determine how this massive rebuilding effort ‚Ä¶ will be funded," he said. "And what we will do with the tremendous amount of existing debt already on the island.Now is not the fucking time to worry about that.  
Just wait till he finds out Manhattan is an island too.

IMPEACH
Just remember when he says things like this that it isn‚Äôt because he is stupid; he talks that way because he thinks we are that stupid. That is why he is so condescending.
He's not wrong. 
Trump is so meta.It's like he's doing impressions of himself because he's seen how popular making fun of him has become.

Big-league water

So he's native american now?
Does he read off a teleprompter? All presidents at some time have used one. I truly don't know if it is used with great frequency or if there's more times than not that there is no teleprompter.If there is one, he clearly interjects it his with his own words and cadence of speech. I mean there's no way it's written that way right? Go fuck yourself San Diego.I'm generally curious. But also I guess pining for some explanation as to how this can all be for real.
Donald wants back on SNL, but they don't need him, they have Baldwin. So he tries to create his own version of real life SNL.I hope one of his generals had the courage to tell him about all the water around North Korea.
Ocean water
A 70 year old man after that speech definitely had to pee.
Half of you fuckers in here voted for him. 
it's just not funny anymore. people that can relatively easily be saved are being left to die and he's still being a fucking clown. 
Big water bad, small water good. Got it
To be fair, this is probably the most intelligent thing he's said all year. It's even technically true!
Fucking retard. Can't wait for him to choke to death on Ivanka's vaginal fluids while he goes down on her

That seven year old's vocabulary comes back into play. 
Stephen Miller's finest speech writing to date.
Can we get a complete quote. Not just one taken way out of context...
Look this is all very funny but I think it‚Äôs time we just left the American people to it. They‚Äôve voted him in and we should give them the respect to elect who they like. 
Ocean Water. Confirmed Trump is a Sonic fan.
What an embarrassment.
Fucking dope. (He really should lay of it whilst in office)
This is like a bushism.
Are people still being surprised that Trump is bad at articulating his thoughts? It's sad, but "Trump doesn't speak well" isn't news to anyone.
ISTHMUS BE A MISTAKE,
You know, I've never really thought of Puerto Rico like that before.
A man was faster than all the other racers, and This is why he won
He is known to speak in a frivolous manner. Obama called US military "corpses" (instead of corps), it happens to everyone. 
You guys realize this subreddit is Trump spam, right? You've come full circle. Well done.
It seems like stating the obvious is like a filler. Instead of saying ‚Äúumm‚Äù or ‚Äúuhhh‚Äù he just says an island is surrounded by water. Makes sense. 
This sub has become its own abyss
